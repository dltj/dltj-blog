  content: Anything OAI-compliant (99%+ of institutional repositories) already does.
    A weblog with a decent Atom feed does. Anything that spits out MARC records does.
    And all else failing, meta tags with Dublin Core should work.

  content: Thanks for the comment, Dorthea.  Those standards are the usual suspects
    in considering a cross-content-silo service like this.  Do you know where more
    detailed documentation about the Firefox Scholar project can be found?  Are there
    things I could be designing into a new repository system that will allow for tighter
    integration with Firefox Scholar?

<p>I first encounted <a href="http://echo.gmu.edu/toolcenter-wiki/index.php?title=Firefox_Scholar_(aka_SmartFox)" title="Zotero (aka Firefox Scholar aka SmartFox) - ToolCenter">Firefox Scholar (a.k.a. SmartFox)</a> in a <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/George-Mason-U-Team-Works-on/25003" title="George Mason U. Team Works on Browser That Will Aid Scholarly Research - Technology - The Chronicle of Higher Education">Chronicle of Higher Education article</a> by Jeffrey Young, and noted with interest this statement in the article:</p>
<blockquote><p>
For the browser-based software to work fully, however, digital archives must format their books and articles in a way that lets it sort out where elements like title, author, and other bibliographic information reside. Some digital collections already do that, and others could make minor adjustments to comply, says Mr. Cohen.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no reference to what changes have to be made beyond the page on CHNM's wiki describing the project in broad terms.  Has anyone else heard of anything?</p>
