<p><a href="http://openrepositories.org/" title="301 Moved Permanently">Open Repositories 2007</a> is coming up next year, and it looks to be an interesting meeting.  The first day is open user group meetings for DSpace, Fedora, and Eprints, followed by general conference sessions that cover issues that cut across all of the open repository systems. This year, the user groups will partition their programs into Plenary, Technical Issues, and Management Issues and the partitions will be staggered so that IT managers can attend all plenary sessions, technical staff can attend all technical sessions, etc.</p>
<p>The <span class="removed_link" title="http://openrepositories.org/call">call for participation</span> for the general conference has gone out.  Its Program Committee is seeking submissions in the form of an extended abstract of no more than 500 words by October 2, 2006. The contributions must be written in English and should be double spaced. The Program Committee will select relevant submissions. Selected speakers will receive an email by November 6, 2006 with guidelines for their presentation. Presentations will be limited to 20 minutes, plus 10 minutes for questions.</p>
<p>This looks to be a really good meeting.  You can track it on HitchHikr at <span class="removed_link" title="http://hitchhikr.com/index.php?conf_id=75">http://hitchhikr.com/index.php?conf_id=75</span>.
