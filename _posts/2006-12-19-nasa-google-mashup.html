<p>Ron Murray (no relation) from the Library of Congress sent me <a title="NASA and Google to Bring Space Exploration Down to Earth" href="http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2006/dec/HQ_06371_Ames_Google.html">this announcement about a joint NASA/Google partnership</a>, which starts:</p>
<blockquote><p>NASA Ames Research Center and Google have signed a Space Act Agreement that formally establishes a relationship to work together on a variety of challenging technical problems ranging from large-scale data management and massively distributed computing, to human-computer interfaces.</p>
<p>As the first in a series of joint collaborations, Google and Ames will focus on making the most useful of NASA's information available on the Internet. Real-time weather visualization and forecasting, high-resolution 3-D maps of the moon and Mars, real-time tracking of the International Space Station and the space shuttle will be explored in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ron went on to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Recall that the principal archival reference model for our community's current archiving effort came from the space data community.
</p></blockquote>
<p>He's referring to the <a href="http://public.ccsds.org/publications/archive/650x0b1.pdf" title="Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System (OAIS); CCSDS Report #650.0-B1">Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System (OAIS)</a>, a product of the <a href="http://public.ccsds.org/" title="Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems homepage">Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems</a>, itself a <a href="http://public.ccsds.org/participation/member_agencies.aspx" title="CCSDS member list">cooperative of major space agencies in the world</a> to discuss <a href="http://public.ccsds.org/about/default.aspx" title="About CCSDS">common problems in the development and operation of space data systems</a>.  Although ostensibly about archiving the digital products of space research and exploration, the committee authoring the document set out to do nothing less than "[develop] a broader consensus on what is required for an archive to provide permanent, or indefinite long-term, preservation of digital information." <footnote>"Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System (OAIS)." Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems. Report #CCSDS 650.0-B-1. p. iii.</footnote></p>
<p>So if the library community is heavily influenced by the OAIS model in how we are now fashioning our technologies, one wonders if this NASA/Google partnership can offer dividends to us as we seek to provide many of the same types of services described in the press release.  OAIS is not, of course, a system specification or a network protocol that would by itself ensure interoperability.  But it certainly can't hurt if we are all talking a similar language.</p>
<p>Food for thought.  What do you think?</p>
