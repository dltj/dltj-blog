  content: "[...] Addressing the first point, with rare exceptions I don&#8217;t see
    institutions as organizations scaling up their technical staff to handle the raw
    building tasks of the kinds of services we&#8217;d like to see in a reconstituted
    vision of the library. I do see some evidence that progress is being made here
    and there, but there are no large programming shops being built to create the
    next ILS-equivalent. (Side note: I hereby apologize for the connotations created
    by the phrase &#8220;next ILS-equivalent&#8221; &#8212; that phrase makes sense
    to me on the surface but it causes deep shudderings in my bones.) I have come
    to believe, though, that tools and techniques from the open source world can be
    used to aggregate the capabilities resident in the distributed &#8220;libraryland&#8221;
    to share the risk and reward of the next ILS-equivalent (damn &#8212; I used it
    again). I wrote about that earlier in an open letter to adherents to Christensen&#8217;s
    philosophies called Aggregation of Risk in Pursuit of Disruptive Technologies
    (comments on that post are still welcome to as we move forward in Ohio with the
    concepts outline there). Also, a colleague from Ohio State and I co-authored an
    article for the SmartClassroom newsletter of Campus Technology about &#8220;betting
    your career&#8221; on open source that I think will have relevance here. The article
    is to be published on the 19th and I&#8217;ll post a copy on DLTJ after a seven-day
    embargo. &#182; [...]"

    of institutions with something in common, with some reason to share insights or
    services. In Ohio, the Ohio Learning Network is sponsoring an open source testbed
    and more than 40 Ohio schools are evaluating a suite of open source tools. The
    Ohio Board of Regents has established a project called Collective Action (the
    open letter posted here provides some background on &ldquo;Collective Action&rdquo;
    and the concept of pooled risk) to aggregate and share open source experiences
    and to evaluate the viability of a shared open source (or hybrid) eLearning infrastructure.

  content: <!--%kramer-ref-pre%-->[...] Looks like there's a counter-revolt of sorts
    going on in the world of education, as librarians and educators - tired of being
    marginalized by technology (i.e. Google) - are fighting back. In Ohio, for example,
    librarians and educators are banding together to come up with a comprehensive
    strategy of disruptive innovation. The Disruptive Library Technology Jester has
    even posted an open letter to disruptive innovation guru Clayton Christensen in
    the hopes of sparking debate. The letter is noteworthy for another reason - it
    includes a generous helping of Internet jargon like "truly disruptive innovations"
    and "loosely coupled organizations." The Disruptive Library Technology Jester
    is a young blog (established in December 2005), but it looks like there's a lot
    of energy here. The tagline for the blog is "We&rsquo;re Disrupted, We&rsquo;re
    Libraries, and We&rsquo;re Not Going to Take It Anymore..." [...]<!--%kramer-ref-post%-->

    and 'disruptive' goals using a method called \"Appreciative Inquiry\" in many
    different organizational settings. It was developed at Case Western - and one
    of our alumni - Chester Bowling - is a faculty memeber at OSU helping to take
    this way of change to organizations in Ohio. Maybe you could chat with him.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nPunya"

<p>An open letter to <a href="http://www.claytonchristensen.com/" title="Clayton Christensen | HBS Professor &amp;amp; Disruptive Innovation Expert">Clayton Christensen</a> as well as colleagues and practitioners of the theories of disruptive innovation:</p>
<p>State agencies in Ohio responsible for primary, secondary and higher education are coming together to share the risk of exploring disruptive technologies and to shepherd the adoption of successful technologies into the mainstream.  We call this group <em>"Collective Action"</em>, and the model of disruptive innovations is a guiding element.  On behalf of the Collective Action group, I am seeking wisdom and thoughts of potential pitfalls of this approach of aggregating risk capital in a loosely-coupled organization.</p>
<p>We take as given that each agency and educational institution can only take on so much risk when they look at the spectrum of technological possibilities.  In doing so, it is the natural inclination to listen too closely to what the customers are saying and avoid possibilities on the disruptive end of the spectrum.</p>
<p>The vision and mission of Collective Action (excerpted below) is to aggregate the risk of each agency and institution in pursuit of truly disruptive innovations.  We think our model has to stray somewhat from that of the business world because each of our parent organizations cannot afford to spin off separate development groups that can work under different business rules -- the taxpayers would likely have a field day.  Collectively pooled and with a long enough leash from our parent organizations, however, we believe that we can pursue actions along the theory of disruptive innovations.</p>
<p>Questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have others followeda similar model of aggregating risk from different organizations under common guiding principles?   We may have something to learn from those that have tried this before.</li>
<li>Based on research of organizational behavior and adoption of innovation, what would be the sort of "lessons learned" that we should seek in the experiences of participants asked to join the group?</li>
<li>At a fundamental level, does this plan to aggregate risk within a semi-autonomous collective fit well with the disruptive innovation theories, and is there advice to be offered to help ensure its success?</li>
</ul>
<p>A subset of the Collective Action group are <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.educause.edu/ELI061/Program/7004?PRODUCT_CODE=ELI061/SESS07">making a presentation</span> at the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081006182550/http://www.educause.edu/eli061" title="http://www.educause.edu/eli061">EDUCAUSE Learning Initiatives</a> summit later this month, at which we will be describing Collective Action within the framework of the disruptive innovation theories.  During the session we will also offer a <a href="/article/christensen-bibliography/">bibliography</a> of materials related to the application of the theories within higher education.  If you have suggestions for other resources, I would be most appreciative to hear about them.</p>
<p>Thank you to you, Michael Raynor, Scott Anthony, and Erik Roth for your efforts to clearly articulate your work and blazing a path for us to follow.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Peter Murray</p>
<p>COLLECTIVE ACTION VISION: Creation of a continuum of quality education and training for Ohioans through the establishment of innovative learning technologies and strategies for their use in Ohio K-20 educational institutions.</p>
<p>COLLECTIVE ACTION MISSION: To foster innovation in education and training through the sharing of risk and resources needed to invoke change. &ldquo;Collective Action&rdquo; refers to the investment of &ldquo;risk capital&rdquo; in a multi-institutional collaboration by agencies and institutions of the Ohio Board of Regents, the Ohio Department of Education, and Ohio-based institutions of primary, secondary, and higher education. These professionals with the pooled resources of their organizations will explore disruptive learning technologies  and learning practices with potential to transform K-20 education and training.
