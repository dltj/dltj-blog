<p>Share your story of implementing an open source system at your library. If selected, you will get paid to develop a case study of your open source system adoption experience and learning.</p>
<p>LYRASIS, in <a href="https://foss4lib.org/article/2012/nov/second-mellon-grant-for-foss4lib">partnership with the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a>, is seeking academic and public libraries to share their experiences with open source systems, such as content repositories or institutional repositories, integrated library systems, or public-facing websites. The two selected case studies will be available on FOSS4Lib.org. This effort, part of the larger <a href="https://www.lyrasis.org/LYRASIS%20Digital/Pages/default.aspx" title="LYRASIS Digital">LYRASIS Digital</a> initiative, is a continuation of LYRASIS working with libraries and other cultural heritage organizations to learn about, evaluate, adopt, and use open source software systems.</p>
<p>More information is available in the formal <a href="https://foss4lib.org/sites/default/files/inline/Open%20Source%20Case%20Study%20Call%20for%20Proposals.pdf">call-for-proposals document</a>. To apply, submit a brief description of the potential case study by email to <a href="mailto:Peter.Murray@lyrasis.org">Peter Murray</a> with the name of the proposed primary author as well as names of others at the library who may contribute to creation of the case study. The deadline for submission is Friday, January 11, 2014.</p>
