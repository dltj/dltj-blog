<p><a href="/article/dltj-and-blogher/web-pages-related-to-dltjorg/" rel="attachment wp-att-212" title="Web Pages Related to DLTJ.ORG"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/dltj-related.png" alt="Web Pages Related to DLTJ.ORG" style="float:right;width:50%;border:1px solid gray;margin-left:1.5em;" /></a><br />
With idle curiosity, I was poking around with <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#038;q=info%3Adltj.org%2F">what Google knows about <i>DLTJ</i></a>.  Perhaps the most interesting piece was the company Google thinks I keep (found via a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#038;q=related%3Adltj.org%2F"><code>related:dltj.org</code> search</a>).  Now most of the links are quite appropriate (the <a href="http://www.lita.org/" title="ALA/LITA homepage">Library and Information Technology Association</a> and <a href="http://www.alatechsource.org/" title="ALA TechSource homepage">ALA TechSource</a> for instance) and some I'm quite pleased to be associated with (Richard Akerman's <a href="http://scilib.typepad.com/" title="Science Library Pad homepage">Science Library Pad</a> blog and Walt Crawford's <a href="http://walt.lishost.org/" title="Walt at Random homepage">Walt at Random</a> blog).  </p>
<p>The one that has me most confused, however, is the link to <a href="http://www.blogher.org/" title="BlogHer homepage">BlogHer</a> ("Where the women bloggers are").  Now, I'm not saying that the link is entirely inappropriate &mdash; the library profession is one  dominated by females &mdash; or that I'm not pleased to be associated with female bloggers...</p>
<p>It's just that I'm wondering what Goggle knows about me &mdash; or at least about <i>DLTJ</i> &mdash; that I don't know about...  <code>;-)</code></p>
