<p>I really like <a href="http://www.claytonchristensen.com/biography/" title="Clayton Christensen biography">Christensen</a>'s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_technology" title="Disruptive technology - Wikipedia">Theory of Disruptive Innovation</a> (as he proposed in his book <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/34320559" title="Find in a Library: The innovator&#039;s dilemma : when new technologies cause great firms to fail">The Innovator's Dilemma</a>).  It succinctly describes the challenges, if not the fate, of academic libraries as we navigate through changing expectations and fast-moving, turbulent technologies.  In fact, I often find that in explaining my point-of-view on where libraries need to go that I draw the core graph of Christensen's theory on napkins, whiteboards, hands &mdash; whatever I can find.  Inevitably, with the enthusiasm for the topic and quick-moving hands, the lines don't always match where they ought and that makes the concepts all that more difficult to explain.</p>
<p><a class="imagelink" style="float: right;" href="/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/christensen-graph.png" title="Graph supporting the Theory of Disruptive Innovation"><img id="image162" src="/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/christensen-graph.thumbnail.png" alt="Graph supporting the Theory of Disruptive Innovation" /></a>To solve the problem, I came up with a version the size of a business card that has not only the graph but also a brief explanation of the key points on the back that the <del>victim</del>, er...<i>listener</i>, can take away from the conversation.  Thinking this might be useful to others as well, I'm offering the <a id="p163" href="/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/disruptive-innovation-cards.pdf" title="Business Cards of the Graph supporting the Theory of Disruptive Innovation">the graph supporting the Theory of Disruptive Innovation and the descriptive text as a PDF download</a> suitable for printing onto <a href="http://www.avery.com/avery/en_us/Templates-&amp;-Software/Templates/Cards/Business-Cards/Business-Card-_-Tall-10-per-sheet_Microsoft-Word.htm" title="http://www.avery.com/us/Main?action=product.Details&amp;catalogcode=WEB01&amp;productcode=27871">Avery 8371</a> (or equivalent) business card stock.</p>
