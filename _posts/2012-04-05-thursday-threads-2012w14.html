<p><i>Thursday Threads</i> has been a back-burner activity for quite a while now.  Blame it on too many interesting things happening at home and at work (to say nothing of the early arrival of spring weather).  This week will be only a slight exception with just two threads of mention rather than the typical three or four.  First is the <a href="#p3644-blackboard">announcement by Blackboard</a> that it is starting up an open source support division and acquiring/hiring some of the bigger names in that sector.  Second is a <a href="#p3644-copyright-drm">reflection on two independent stories</a> about the effect of copyright uncertainty and digital rights management on book materials.</p>
<p>Feel free to send this to others you think might be interested in the topics.  If you find these threads interesting and useful, you might want to add the <a title="RSS Feed for DLTJ Thursday Threads" href="http://feeds.dltj.org/thursday-threads/">Thursday Threads RSS Feed</a> to your feed reader or subscribe to e-mail delivery using the form to the right.  <em>New this year is that <strong>Pinboard has replaced FriendFeed as my primary aggregation service</strong>.</em> If you would like a more raw and immediate version of these types of stories, watch <a title="Peter Murray | Pinboard" href="http://pinboard.in/u:dltj">my Pinboard bookmarks</a> (or subscribe to <a title="RSS feed for Peter Murray's Pinboard account" href="http://feeds.pinboard.in/rss/u:dltj/">its feed</a> in your feed reader).

<h2 id="p3644-blackboard">Blackboard Pivots Towards Open Source</h2>
<blockquote><p>Today we are making some big announcements that we know will catch the attention of many members of the education community. Taken together, they speak to a broader shift in our strategy for serving education institutions so we are taking a moment to share some thoughts about our approach.</p>
<p>The high level change is this: Blackboard is becoming a multiple learning platform company that supports both commercially developed software as well as open source solutions.

</blockquote>
<p>Last week Blackboard announced a four-part strategy to join the open source community:  1. the <a href="http://www.blackboard.com/about-bb/news-center/Press-Releases.aspx?releaseid=1676740" title="Blackboard Press Release">formation</a> of an <a href="http://www.blackboard.com/services/blackboard-education-open-source-services.aspx" title="Blackboard Services">open source services group</a>; 2. the <a href="http://www.blackboard.com/About-Bb/News-Center/Press-Releases.aspx?releaseid=1676738" title="Blackboard Press Release">acquisition</a> of <a href="http://www.moodlerooms.com/home" title="Moodlerooms homepage">Moodlerooms</a> and <a href="http://www.netspot.com.au/" title="NetSpot homepage">NetSpot</a>; 3. the <a href="http://www.blackboard.com/About-Bb/News-Center/Press-Releases.aspx?releaseid=1676736" title="Blackboard Press Release">hiring</a> of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120405023224/https://sakaiproject.org/sakai-foundation" title="The Sakai Foundation | Sakai Project">Sakai Foundation</a> Board Member <a href="http://www.dr-chuck.com/" title="Dr. Chuck's Awesome Home Page">Charles Severance</a> to lead Blackboard's Sakai initiatives; and 4. the <a href="http://www.blackboard.com/About-Bb/News-Center/Press-Releases.aspx?releaseid=1676733" title="Blackboard Press Release">announcement</a> of continued support for <a href="http://www.blackboard.com/Platforms/Learn/Products/Blackboard-Learn/ANGEL-Edition.aspx" title="Blackboard Learn | ANGEL Edition">Angel</a> (a proprietary platform and company that Blackboard acquired in 2009).  Phil Hill has a <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/summary-of-statements-by-key-players-in-blackboard-announcement-including-competitors/" title="- e-Literate">wrap-up of public statements from Blackboard and commercial competitors to Blackboard</a>.</p>
<p>You might remember Blackboard from its now <a href="https://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/blackboard-settles-longstanding-patent-fight-with-rival-desire2learn/9229" title="Blackboard Settles Longstanding Patent Fight With Rival Desire2Learn | Chronicle of Higher Education">infamous patent lawsuit</a> with competitor Desire2Learn in which <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/blackboard_patents_the_lms/" title="Blackboard Patents the LMS | e-Literate">Blackboard tried to claim invention rights</a> to the fundamentals of any computer-mediated learning management system.  Blackboard <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2008/02/blackboard-wins-lawsuit-against-desire2learn.aspx" title="Blackboard Wins Lawsuit Against Desire2Learn | Campus Technology">initially won the lawsuit</a> but the finding was <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/07/28/blackboard" title="Blackboard Loses on Appeal | Inside Higher Ed">overturned</a> at the appellate level.  That was all after Blackboard issued a "<a href="http://www.blackboard.com/about-bb/news-center/press-releases/Archive.aspx?releaseid=956876" title="Blackboard Press Release Archive">non-assertion pledge</a>" following <a href="http://www.educause.edu/blog/cluckett/ImportantAnnouncementEDUCAUSES/166630" title="Important Announcement: EDUCAUSE-Sakai Statement on Blackboard Patent Pledge | EDUCAUSE">discussions with both EDUCAUSE and the Sakai Foundation</a>.  (Interestingly, the <a href="http://www.blackboard.com/patent" title="Original URL to the Blackboard Patent Pledge; now redirects to a page-not-found error">original pledge</a> is no longer available from the Blackboard website; it is available <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090301192635/http://www.blackboard.com/getdoc/ee803a3a-cf08-464c-8926-7268a5dcdb15/Patent-Pledge.aspx" title="Blackboard Patents">through the Internet Archive Wayback Machine</a>.)  Blackboard has an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackboard_Inc.#Recent_expansion" title="Blackboard Inc. - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">extensive history of buying companies</a> and integrating them with its core software, so one has to wonder what this move towards open source means for not only Sakai and Moodle, but for the core Blackboard product as well.  Audrey Watters sums up some of the <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2012/03/26/blackboard-moodlerooms-open-washing/" title="You Can Acquire Open Source Companies, But You Can't Buy Open Source Community">concerns</a> from the open source community while "Dr. Chuck" reflects on <a href="http://www.dr-chuck.com/csev-blog/2012/03/reflecting-on-a-week-of-sakai-blackboard-and-open-source/" title="Reflecting on a Week of Sakai, Blackboard, and Open Source | Dr. Chucks Blog">the state of institutional support for open source software versus what commercial companies are putting into the effort</a>.  Laura Gekeler <a href="http://lauragekeler.com/2012/04/03/stalking-sakai/" title="Stalking Sakai | Laura Gekeler Speaks Her Mind">pulls no punches</a> in contemplating what that means.</p>
<h2 id="p3644-copyright-drm">Copyright and DRM</h2>
<blockquote><div style="text-align: right; width: 100%;">There's been quite a bit of chatter lately about some research by Professor <a href="http://www.law.illinois.edu/faculty/profile/PaulHeald" title="Paul Heald - Faculty | College of Law - Illinois">Paul Heald</a> from the University of Illinois. Heald recently delivered a seminar on the stagnating effects of extended copyright terms in the U.S., and blogger Eric Crampton immediately called attention to <a href="http://offsettingbehaviour.blogspot.co.nz/2012/03/copyright-stagnation.html" title="Copyright stagnation | Offsetting Behaviour">one data-set about books that is particularly telling</a> (found through <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/03/30/infinite_copyright_is_killing_culture.html" title="Infinite Copyright Is Killing Culture | Slate">Slate</a>) which illustrates what The Atlantic has dubbed <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/03/the-missing-20th-century-how-copyright-protection-makes-books-vanish/255282/" title="The Missing 20th Century: How Copyright Protection Makes Books Vanish | The Atlantic">"The Missing 20th Century"</a>. It's the number of titles available from Amazon as new editions (as opposed to used copies) graphed by the decade of original publication:</p>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/m9zif" title="imgur: the simple image sharer"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/m9zif.png" title="Hosted by imgur.com" alt=""/></a></p>
<p>The source of that massive fall-off at the midpoint is seemingly simple: all books published in the U.S. in 1922 or earlier are in the public domain. What's immediately apparent from this graph is the fact that copyright is limiting the public's access to older works&mdash;but why and how, exactly? The answer lies in the reality of what a copyright is really worth, commercially, and how long it retains that value&mdash;and it sheds light on another problem with copyright law.</p></div>

<p>I do wonder what will be left in archives decades from now.  It does seem like some forms of creative media are under assault from this double-barrel shotgun: uncertainty of public domain status for content from the 1920s to the 1980s and, arguably when we get our recordkeeping act together on ownership from the 1990s forward, the content will be locked up in digital rights management encoded formats.</p>
