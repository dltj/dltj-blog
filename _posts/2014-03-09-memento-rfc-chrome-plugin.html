<p>A belated congratulations to the <a href="http://www.mementoweb.org/" title="Memento: Adding Time to the Web">Memento</a> team on the publication of their <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7089" title="403 Forbidden">RFC</a> and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/memento-time-travel/jgbfpjledahoajcppakbgilmojkaghgm/details">Google Chrome plugin</a> for the Memento WWW time travel protocol.  A fan of the <a href="http://archive.org/web/" title="Internet Archive: Wayback Machine">Internet Archive Wayback Machine</a>?  Ever look at the history of a Wikipedia page?  Curious to know about changes to a particular web page?  The first is now easier to access...the second is a work in progress...and the third may come to a website near you.  See what I mean through this demonstration video.<br />

<p>If you want to see more of the details, check out the <a href="http://www.mementoweb.org/guide/quick-intro/" title="Memento Guide: Introduction">guided introduction</a>.  If you are a hardcore techie, take a look at the text of <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7089" title="403 Forbidden">RFC 7089</a>.  If you'd like to try it out yourself, load up Chrome and install the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/memento-time-travel/jgbfpjledahoajcppakbgilmojkaghgm/details">Memento extension</a>.  Because the Chrome Web Store won't let you see the details of an extension unless you are actually using Chrome, I've reproduced the description here:</p>
<blockquote><p> Travel to the past of the web by right-clicking pages and links.</p>
<p>Memento for Chrome allows you to seamlessly navigate between the present web and the web of the past. It turns your browser into a web time travel machine that is activated by means of a Memento sub-menu that is available on right-click.</p>
<p>First, select a date for time travel by clicking the black Memento extension icon. Now right-click on a web page, and click the "Get near &hellip;" option from the Memento sub-menu to see what the page looked like around the selected date. Do the same for any link in a page to see what the linked page looked like. If you hit one of those nasty "Page not Found" errors, right-click and select the "Get near current time" option to see what the page looked like before it vanished from the web. When on a past version of a page - the Memento extension icon is now red - right-click the page and select the "Get current time" option to see what it looks like now.</p>
<p>Memento for Chrome obtains prior versions of pages from web archives around the world, including the massive web-wide Internet Archive, national archives such as the British Library and UK National Archives web archives, and on-demand web archives such as archive.is. It also allows time travel in all language versions of Wikipedia. There's two things Memento for Chrome can not do for you: obtain a prior version of a page when none have been archived and time travel into the future. Our sincere apologies for that.</p>
<p>Technically, the Memento for Chrome extension is a client-side implementation of the Memento protocol that extends HTTP with content negotiation in the date time dimension. Many web archives have implemented server-side support for the Memento protocol, and, in essence, every content management system that supports time-based versioning can implement it. Technical details are in the Memento Internet Draft at http://www.mementoweb.org/guide/rfc/ID/. General information about the protocol, including a quick introduction, is available at http://mementoweb.org.</p>

<p>The Memento team is also developing a <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Memento" title="Extension:Memento - MediaWiki">plugin for Mediawiki</a> that speaks the Memento protocol.  The effort to get it into the English Wikipedia has <a href="https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=34778">stalled at the moment</a>, but I expect the developers will give it another go at some point.
