<p>It has been years since I've done meaningful work with JPEG2000, but I still try to keep tabs on what is happening in that community.  In that vein, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/rob-buckley/0/290/354" title="Rob Buckley  | LinkedIn">Rob Buckley</a> -- formerly of Xerox Research and now on his own with a consulting business -- pointed me to an announcement about a <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.nccsite.com/jpeg2000/">JPEG2000 Summit happening at the Library of Congress next month</span>.<br />
<!--more--><br />
The plan for the meeting is:<br />
<blockquote>The program starts with a half-day tutorial on JPEG 2000 on the morning of the first day, followed by two sessions of presentations. The program will conclude on the afternoon of the second day with a small invitation-only working session to identify key objectives and collaborations for broadening the understanding and use of the technology.</p></blockquote>
<p>  <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.nccsite.com/jpeg2000/registration/">Registration</span> is free but required because of the limited space.  If I were in or near D.C., I'd surely be there but my day job doesn't align well enough to the agenda to justify the trip.  I continue to think that use of JPEG2000 is a significant enough upgrade to TIFF practices for archiving and presentation to justify the cost of making a transition.  (That statement says nothing about a wholesale conversion of archive TIFFs to JPEG2000s; existing TIFFs can stay as they are but current practice should take advantage of the features offered with JPEG2000.)  The organizers are ending the summit with "a small invitation-only working session to identify key objectives and collaborations for broadening the understanding and use of the technology."  I'm looking forward to the output of that working group.
