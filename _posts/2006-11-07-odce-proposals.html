<p>Proposals for the <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.oln.org/conferences/ODCE2007/ODCE2007.php">Ohio Digital Commons for Education 2007 Conference</span> &mdash; The Convergence of Learning, Libraries and Technology &mdash; are due on Friday, November 17, 2006.  The conference committee established these tracks:</p>
<ul>
<li>E Squared: Effectiveness and Efficiencies</li>
<li>STEM2: Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics and Medicine</li>
<li>Who are the Learners? Serving New Audiences</li>
<li>WMP: Wireless, Mobile and Personal</li>
<li>Reinventing the Learning Environment: Walking the Walk</li>
<li>What's The Buzz? Vendor Presentations</li>
</ul>
<p>The <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.oln.org/conferences/ODCE2007/ODCE2007_Final_CALL.pdf">call for presentations, preconference workshops, and demonstrations of innovation</span> [PDF] is online, as is the <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.oln.org/conferences/ODCE2007/ODCE2007proposal.php">proposal submission form</span>.  I am serving as co-chair of the "<b>WMP</b>: Wireless, Mobile and Personal" track, so I am admittedly posting out of self interest to get the highest quality proposals to show the other track chairs that we are not "<b>W</b>i<b>MP</b>s".  Here is what we're looking for:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Walk into a coffee shop and count the devices riding on free wireless. What is going on out there? Will iTunes be the next great university?  Is just-in-time, just-for-me learning finally here?  Will gamers drive how we  present content in 2012? Proposals in this track should highlight the resources (blogs, databases, digital media, etc.), services (instant messaging reference, federated searching, etc.), pedagogy, and collaborations necessary for effective education in a digital environment.   </p>
<p>Example topics for this track might include but are not limited to:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrate podcasting and audioblogs in the delivery of instructional content.</li>
<li>Can gaming improve learning in accountable ways?</li>
<li>Evaluation of the effect that these technologies and commensurate pedagogies have on student learning.</li>
<li>What can we build into physical rooms today that enables tomorrow's learning?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
