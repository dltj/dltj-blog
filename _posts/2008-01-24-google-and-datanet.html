    The speculation at the end of the post: [quote
    post="318"]One wonders about the viability of creating a
    response to the DataNet solicitation that, in effect, outsources
    the cyberinfrastructure piece to Google and focuses on building the
    sustainable organization model surrounding the description and
    dissemination of the data.[/quote] raises the question of why
    Google would enter into such an arrangement? Their model -- bring
    eyes into proximity to Google-ads -- may be an answer, but by and
    large they aren't known as an organization eager to surrender
    policy or strategy choices to others, which is pretty much what
    would be implied in one of the 'new organizations' that NSF calls
    out as a central objective of the DataNet solicitation. Interesting
    idea, though. stu, who is also a DataNet supplicant.

    hoping its obvious that I've misused the "quote selected text"

  content: "Stu --\r\n\r\nFirst, I patched the problem that attributed the quote to
    you; it is apparently a known bug in the <a href=\"http://www.damagedgoods.it/wp-plugins/quoter/\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">Quoter</a> plug-in to WordPress.  The attribution line is gone,
    at least, until a permanent fix is made.\r\n\r\nAs to your question of whether
    Google would enter into a 'new organization' arrangement with partners:  that
    is a real unknown in this scheme.  Google has not been very transparent in many
    of its motives beyond its stated mission to \"organize the world's information
    and make it universally accessible and useful.\"  Long-time readers of <acronym
    title=\"Disruptive Library Technology Jester\"><i>DLTJ</i></acronym>know that
    <a href=\"http://dltj.org/2007/08/clashing-values/\" rel=\"nofollow\">I'm aware
    that commercial motives are not in perfect alignment with not-for-profit (particularly
    higher education) motives</a>.  Still, if we are not successful in the first round
    of DataNet partner selection, I would propose that we approach Google in a partnership
    that would pair their <em>high-tech</em> cyberinfrastructure with a <em>high-touch</em>
    cadre of specialists that would help researchers <strong>effectively</strong>
    get their stuff into the Google Research buckets.  Or, said another way, the high-touch
    portions of the partnership would bring better data and metadata to the Google
    Research site.\r\n\r\nIt would me, of course, that the working relationship would
    extend to the parts of the DataNet solicitation that call for interoperability
    with other DataNet sites, and that might mean opening up programming interfaces
    into Google Research that they had not intended to pursue.  It would also likely
    mean that Google would need to add data preservation to their suite of services
    surrounding the Google Research project.  From the outside, it is difficult to
    tell whether Google Research is already considering the issues of preservation,
    or if they just consider it an \"access\" platform.\r\n\r\nIf anyone inside Google
    is reading this and finds it interesting, feel free to give me a call.  My contacts
    inside your organization are severely limited to non-existent."

  content: "Peter, (Stu),\r\n\r\nI floated into your (very nice) domain  while trying
    to track down the Blue Ribbon task force's first page and also checked out your
    comments elsewhere.\r\n\r\nA question re:  \"the new organization\".  I know everyone
    should have a blog today. The idea I guess is so that you have the pleasure of
    splitting every conversation, about similar things at different times,  between
    hundreds of domains.  As librarians I suppose you're ensuring the growth of stuff
    which will need classifying (with metadata of course).\r\n\r\nCan you tell me
    though. Taking that everyone in your library world considers  the term 'data'
    to be interchangeable with 'information', and that communication between peers
    must reflect their institution's standing i.e. each must pump out the same information,
    like this press release, http://www.oclc.org/news/releases/200692.htm, which litters
    about 20 domains (so far). Do you think there may come a time where you and your
    peers might collaborate to produce and share an interactive environment?\r\n\r\nI
    was just considering this embryonic interactive  TV station/ Like most others
    it hits the wall as soon as they try and figure out how communities can be categorized
    in a (tool centric) domain. http://www.scivee.tv/about\r\n\r\nAny chance we could
    reverse the approach = classify a community first (maybe using a bibliographic
    number) and then see about backing some tools into their domain."

<p>Wired Magazine's blog network says "<a href="http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/01/google-to-provi.html" title="Google to Host Terabytes of Open-Source Science Data | Wired Science from Wired.com">Google to Host Terabytes of Open-Source Science Data</a>" while the National Science Foundation (NSF) is reviewing submissions to the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2007/nsf07601/nsf07601.htm" title="Sustainable Digital Data Preservation and Access Network Partners   (DataNet)   nsf07601">DataNet solicitation</a> "to catalyze the development of a system of science and engineering data collections that is open, extensible and evolvable."  On the surface, you might think they are working on the same project, but there is more here than meets the eye (or, rather, the ear listening to these two sound-bites).</p>
<p>Disclosure:  OhioLINK is a named party in a submission by The Ohio State University to the NSF DataNet solicitation.  We're looking forward to a positive reception to our proposal in the first round of DataNet reviews.</p>
<p>As with most things Google, the real nuts and bolts of their strategy are unknown until Google chooses to unveil them.  This much seems to be known:  under the moniker of "Google Research" the company will make large datasets available to the world for free.  According to the Wired article, "two planned datasets are all 120 terabytes of Hubble Space Telescope data and the images from the <a href="http://www.archimedespalimpsest.org/" title="Archimedes Palimpsest">Archimedes Palimpsest</a>, the 10th century manuscript that <a href="http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid5_gci1246719,00.html" title="Google steps into academic storage">inspired the Google dataset storage project</a>."  Sources at Google told Wired that the Research site will offer YouTube-style annotation features and <a href="http://dltj.org/2007/05/data-visualization/">data visualization technology purchased from Gapminder</a> last year.  Part of the plan also includes the shipping and loaning of large disk packs so the data doesn't have to flow across the internet.  The presumed home of Google Research is <a href="http://research.google.com/" title="Google Research Home">http://research.google.com/</a>.  At this point, that URL describes contributions by Google staff to the research community, but I'm guess that will change when the new service is brought public.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the NSF DataNet solicitation envisions a new type of organization that "will integrate library and archival sciences, cyberinfrastructure, computer and information sciences, and domain science expertise to: provide reliable digital preservation, access, integration, and analysis capabilities for science and/or engineering data...; anticipate and adapt to changes in technologies and in user needs and expectations; [perform R/D in] computer and information science and cyberinfrastructure...; and serve as component elements of an interoperable data preservation and access network."  More than a <em>service</em>, DataNet seeks a model of <em>organization</em> that brings varied expertise together on the issues surrounding data curation.  By way of comparison, it would seem like NSF thinks of this as a people challenge while Google Research thinks of it as a technology platform challenge.</p>
<p>A technology platform is certainly part of the DataNet needs, but not all of it.  As one of the commenters in the Wired article noted, "masses of data are of course completely useless without extensive meta-data describing provinence."  Still, given the cyberinfrastructure that Google can bring to bear on the problem of large scale data archiving and the dataset visualization technology that they now have in house, it is a big part of a potential solution.  One wonders about the viability of creating a response to the DataNet solicitation that, in effect, outsources the cyberinfrastructure piece to Google and focuses on building the sustainable organization model surrounding the description and dissemination of the data.</p>
<p>Anybody working on that?</p>
