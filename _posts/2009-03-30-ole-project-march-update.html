<p>Participants in the design phase of the <a href="http://oleproject.org/" title="The OLE Project">OLE Project</a> met in Lawrence, Kansas, earlier this month for a week-long work session.  Coming out of the session are several documents that form the foundational elements of the report to be published and delivered to Mellon in July.  Interested parties are invited and encouraged to sign up for the <span class="removed_link" title="http://oleproject.org/2009/03/13/ole-project-update-public-webinar-march-31-2009/">project update webinar</span> to be held on March 31st from 3:00pm to 4:30pm (Eastern time).  There will be a project update at the <span class="removed_link" title="http://oleproject.org/2009/02/23/coalition-for-networked-information-cni-task-force-meeting/">Coalition for Networked Information (CNI) Task Force Meeting</span> on April 7th.  Those in the midwest might also be interested in the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090417230634/http://oleproject.org/2009/03/18/ole-workshop-indianapolis-in/" title="OLE Project Workshop in Indianapolis, IN">Indianapolis OLE Workshop</a> on April 22nd.</p>
<p>One document is the updated <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090427091101/http://oleproject.org/faqs/" title="OLE Project FAQs">Frequently Asked Questions</a>; this has answers to the common questions received during the previous regional workshops and webcasts.  This is backed up by two other documents:  first the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090417230709/http://oleproject.org/overview/assumptions/" title="OLE Project Assumptions">assumptions underlying the design of OLE</a> and the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090218225221/http://oleproject.org/overview/project-scope/" title="OLE Project  Scope">OLE project scope</a>.  The latter is notable in particular because it was updated to take on the perspective of the OLE Project in general, not specifically the design phase of the project (as it was originally).</p>
