  content: "The Library of Congress Preservation Directorate's Digital Preservation
    laboratory has - in anticipation of this critical Cultural Heritage community
    development - been investigating methods for determining JPEG 2000 quality encoding
    settings for a range of image content and use.\r\n\r\nIf parties reading this
    post want to start an online discussion along those lines on the Jester, please
    respond here. A potential venue for this discussion is the JPEG 2000 in Archives
    and Libraries website -->> http://j2karclib.info/ \r\n\r\nThat site has been around
    for around five years now, but should now see increased activity as a function
    of interest in djatoka."

  content: "Ron -- I hope interest now starts in earnest around JPEG2000 as an access
    format now that an open source, web based viewing engine is now available.  Then
    institutions can really start to see that a very good access format is also a
    very good preservation format.\r\n\r\nanon -- I believe djatoka is using a freely
    redistributable compiled Kakadu library.  So while Kakadu is not open source itself,
    its use here as a compiled library is within bounds of most definitions of \"open
    source\"."

    we are now serving all page images via djatoka [http://biodiversitylibrary.blogspot.com/2009/01/now-serving-all-page-images-via-djatoka.html].
    \ Also, I have written a detailed breakout of the architecture I've designed to
    provide this service on my blog [http://www.fak3r.com/2009/01/27/howto-serve-jpeg2000-images-with-a-scalable-infrastructure/]\r\n\r\nSo
    far djatoka, has been tremendous, it's stable, fast and was easy to implement.
    \ The only thing that took time was the reworking of the viewer, our dev reworked
    the newer iipviewer with mootools (code release forthcoming) to function more
    like our old viewer.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nPhil"

    a chance to blog pointers to it.  Thank you for doing so (both for the work and
    for telling us about it!).

<p>The <a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september08/chute/09chute.html" title="Introducing djatoka: A Reuse Friendly, Open Source JPEG 2000 Image Server">lead article</a> in the <a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september08/09contents.html" title="D-Lib Magazine (September/October 2008)">September/October issue of D-Lib Magazine</a> release yesterday is on <span class="removed_link" title="http://megalodon.lanl.gov/aDORe/projects/djatoka/">djatoka</span>, the open source JPEG2000 Image Server from Los Alamos National Laboratory.  The authors, <a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september08/authors/09authors.html#CHUTE" title="Ryan Chute&#039;s bio a D-Lib Magazine">Ryan Chute</a> and <a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september08/authors/09authors.html#VANDESOMPEL" title="Herbert Van de Sompel&#039;s bio at D-Lib Magazine">Herbert Van de Sompel</a> describe their effort in the article abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p>The ISO-standardized JPEG 2000 image format has started to attract significant attention. Support for the format is emerging in major consumer applications, and the cultural heritage community seriously considers it a viable format for digital preservation. So far, only commercial image servers with JPEG 2000 support have been available. They come with significant license fees and typically provide the customers with limited extensibility capabilities. Here, we introduce djatoka, an open source JPEG 2000 image server with an attractive basic feature set, and extensibility under control of the community of implementers. We describe djatoka, and point at demonstrations that feature digitized images of marvelous historical manuscripts from the collections of the British Library and the University of Ghent. We also call upon the community to engage in further development of djatoka.</p></blockquote>
<p><!--break--><br />
The article is very easy to read and is a great overview of how they built the djatoka image server.  LANL has a <span class="removed_link" title="http://african.lanl.gov/adore-djatoka/">demonstration site</span> with images of the Magna Carta from the British Library.  The <a href="http://www.antifonarium-tsgrooten.be/highlights.htm" title="Universiteitsbibliotheek Gent | Antifonarium Tsgrooten">University of Ghent has also deployed a djatoka installation</a> with some digitized pages of a Gregorian choir book.  (The text of the site is in Dutch, I think, but you can click on the square boxes to the right of "Fol." to bring up the images.)  LANL has also put together a screencast demonstration of djatoka, included below.</p>
<p>djatoka is available under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html" title="About the GNU Lesser General Public License">GNU Lesser General Public License</a>.  The software has <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/djatoka" title="SourceForge.net: djatoka">a site on SourceForge</a> with forums for discussion.  It runs as a Java servlet, so it is pretty much cross-platform.  In the image server is the Kakadu JPEG2000 toolkit and the <a href="http://iipimage.sourceforge.net/" title="SourceForge.net: IIPImage">IIPImage JavaScript Viewer</a> toolkit.  One other key piece is a fascinating use of an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenURL" title="OpenURL - Wikipedia">OpenURL</a> ContextObject to carry the service request information from the browser through the image server to the caching and rendering pieces.</p>
<p>Congratulations and kudos to Ryan, Herbert, and the team at LANL for putting together this great piece of software and releasing it as open source.<span class="Z3988" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&#038;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&#038;rft.jtitle=D-Lib+Magazine&#038;rft.id=info:DOI/10.1045%2Fseptember2008-chute&#038;rft.atitle=Introducing+djatoka%3A+A+Reuse+Friendly%2C+Open+Source+JPEG+2000+Image+Server&#038;rft.date=2008&#038;rft.volume=14&#038;rft.issue=9%2F10&#038;rft.spage=&#038;rft.epage=&#038;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dlib.org%2Fdlib%2Fseptember08%2Fchute%2F09chute.html&#038;rft.au=Ryan+Chute&#038;rft.au=Herbert+Van+de+Sompel&#038;bpr3.included=1&#038;bpr3.tags=Computer+Science%2CHuman-Computer+Interaction">Ryan Chute, Herbert Van de Sompel (2008).
