  content: "Thanks for the clarification and narrowing of the discussion. I don't
    doubt that online catalog use within (many) (academic) libraries is declining,
    just as circulation in (some) (academic) libraries seems to be declining. \r\n\r\nI
    certainly don't argue that catalogs work as well as they should. Does it continue
    to make sense for academic libraries to have online catalogs as such? That's a
    tougher question...one that I think needs some fairly subtle discussion, involving
    a lot of issues/tradeoffs.\r\n\r\nAs to the three questions: I'd say \"absolutely
    not\" for the first, \"requires loads of discussion\" for the second, and \"it's
    happened more often than you might expect,\" but of course Eureka serves/served
    several hundred libraries.\r\n\r\nYou say I don't run an OPAC. That's true, but
    I have been lead designer for a search system that includes the second largest
    bibliographic database in the world, and I probably know more about use of that
    system than anyone else. Back in the day (not that many years ago), we used log
    analysis, statistical returns, and focus groups to redesign the sequence of defaults
    and options, based on the clear finding that if there's a default search option,
    that will be used far more than any other search option, even if it's the \"wrong\"
    search option. (And, given the rest of the Eureka interface, it seemed needlessly
    user-hostile *not* to have a default option: We thought it should be feasible
    for at least 40-50% of searchers to do no more than key in a term and hit Enter.)
    So title browse is the default for bibliographic databases, because it's the fastest
    way to find known items; author browse is second, subject browse third, keyword
    is fourth. (If we had a properly-working full-record phrase-sensitive keyword
    index, I'd argue that keyword should be third and subject should only be on advanced
    search). Sure enough, 51% of RLG Union Catalog searches via Eureka are title,
    and those are overwhelmingly successful, 88% yielding 1 to 10 records. (As you
    might guess, author searches are second most frequent--but, because Eureka for
    the RLG Union Catalog tends to be used heavily by reference folks, I think, Boolean
    searches are third.)\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, for articles, \"title as the default\"
    would be, well, dumb. Since we do have full-record keyword for all other databases,
    and since we know what's likely to work best (or \"least badly\"), keyword is
    the default, followed by author (browse), title *word* (not a browse), subject
    *word*, and journal (browse). And, guess what, keyword is significantly more than
    half of all searches in most of those databases...\r\n\r\nThat's probably more
    of a comment than you were looking for. I don't think there's anything new about
    the \"default gets used most\" finding. I won't comment on systems that don't
    have defaults; I choose my battles..."

  content: "Thanks for the detailed and informed reply, Walt.  I'm not sure what I
    was looking for in a comment but your writing was certainly more than I had hoped.\r\n\r\nAs
    you might guess, I think this discussion is absolutely key.  The \"Integrated\"
    part of the ILS used to be a real asset -- there was only one system you needed
    for buying, describing, discovering and lending items.  Today, though, I offer
    than 'integrated' is manifested as 'silo' and as such we are locked into 30-year-old
    ways of doing things with 30-year-old architectures.  Of course, if something
    is time tested and works for you, one wouldn't change it.\r\n\r\nMy argument would
    be that the ILS-as-we-know-it is no longer working for us now.  Some examples:\r\n\r\nWe
    debate whether biblographic records should mix formats or not (while working libraries
    wait for FRBR to catch on and vendors wait for working libraries to ask-for/demand
    FRBR).\r\nWe try to smoosh the electronic resources acquisitions process into
    existing systems and processes.  Is an Britannica Online an electronic resource
    or a serial or a monographic set or an electronic book?  It is, of course, a little
    bit of all three, but in many technical services departments it seems like the
    answer to that question would drive the purchase into a particular workflow that,
    because of the other facets of Britannica Online, are ill-suited for the material
    type.\r\nUsers want to find, not search (the classic distinction between librarians
    and our constituency) and they are getting used to interfaces out on the wild
    wild web that return decent results from a single search box.  As demonstrated
    by the likes of Amazon and others, we can build enough intelligence and usability
    into systems to enable the single search box to find known or nearly-known items.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf
    we can agree on that much -- ILS performance over-supply plus models/workflows
    that no longer exist (#1 and #2 above) plus underserved users (#3) -- let's get
    started on the \"loads of discussion\" because we have a long way to go."

  content: "<!--%kramer-ref-pre%-->[...] July 11, 2206 - I am no longer updating this
    list of OPAC Blog posts on this site. For the most recent version of this post,
    please visit the OPAC Blog Posts - A List via WordPress. It has become too difficult
    to update the list in both places.The latest assignment for my summer class is
    a 10-15 page paper about one cataloging related subject that we choose from a
    list of 15 suggested topics (due on July 17th). Although I haven&rsquo;t made
    my final choice about the theme of the paper, many of the suggestions on the professor&rsquo;s
    list deal with the automated library catalog and the user&rsquo;s experience of
    searching. I&rsquo;m interested in using some of the recent blog discussions about
    the OPAC/library catalog/ILS as part of my paper. As such, I&rsquo;ve started
    putting together a list of relevant blog posts. This list is a work in progress.
    I intend to update the list - and start annotating it as part of my research.
    LibrarianInBlack Karen and the Sucky OPAC - The LibrarianInBlack comments on Karen
    Schneider&rsquo;s &ldquo;How OPACs Suck, Part 1: Relevance Rank (Or the Lack of
    It),&rdquo; The LIB comments that &rdquo; This relevancy ranking issue is one
    of those changes I&rsquo;d like to see happen. I agree with Karen that this is
    something that librarians should be demanding&hellip;not simply wishing for.&rdquo;
    Library website goals - The LIB agrees about the importance of single sign on
    (which isn&rsquo;t something that we are even close to at my small library either!!)
    and references John Blyberg&rsquo;s post Library 2.0 websites: Where to begin?
    Family Man Librarian Library online catalogs and relevancy ranking[updated] -
    A post in which the Family Man Librarian disagrees with Karen Schneiders&rsquo;
    post How OPACs Suck, Part 1: Relevance Rank (Or the Lack of It). The FML takes
    issue with Karen&rsquo;s points that most online catalogs don&rsquo;t have relevance
    ranking and that ILS vendors are wholly to blame for this lack of relevance ranking.
    FML contends that we need to &ldquo;look at both sides of the issue and especially
    do not be so quick to lay blame without truly understanding the reality of what
    vendors provide and what they do.&rdquo; Blyberg.net 2006: the year of the phoenix
    OPAC? - In this post, John Blyberg points to several significant developments
    in OPACs: NCSU&rsquo;s new online catalog, Casey Bisson&rsquo;s WordPress OPAC
    project, Ed Vielmetti&rsquo;s third-party library apps with RSS feeds and Dave
    Pattern&rsquo;s work with a new patron-oriented presentation layer to the OPAC.
    Blyberg&rsquo;s own experiences also lead him to conclude that the public is &ldquo;hungry&rdquo;
    for social additives to the catalog. Blyberg writes that 2006 &ldquo;is shaping
    up to be the year a new OPAC vision is created.&rdquo; ILS Customer Bill of Rights
    - John Blyberg details &ldquo;four simple, but fundamental&rdquo; needs from ILS
    vendors: 1) Open, read-only, direct access to the database, 2)A full-blown, W3C
    standards-based API to all read-write functions, 3)The option to run the ILS on
    hardware of our choice, on servers that we administer and 4) High security standards.
    Library 2.0 websites: Where to begin? - John suggests five directives to help
    redesign library web sites: social software, open-source software, single sign-on,
    open standards and an integrated OPAC. Why bother: the impact of social OPACs
    - Blyberg makes is clear that he does not &ldquo;think we are doomed if we choose
    not to implement social software in our OPAC.&rdquo; He contends that by adding
    social software and/or applications we can create a feeling of community within
    our OPACs. One key point is that &ldquo;findability is not the goal, but the activity
    and the experience which is why I say that OPACs have the potential to be fascinating
    places to visit and browse.&rdquo; OPACs in the frying pan, Vendors in the fires
    - A round up of blog posts about OPACs, ILS and vendors for early June 2006. A
    Wandering Eyre Actual Reasons Why My OPAC Sucks - Jane offers 16 actual reasons
    why her OPAC sucks in response to an actual comment. OPACS (everyone together
    now) SUCK - Jane reflects about the the concepts of tracking and finding in relation
    to the OPAC and about how they are different. She suggests that these two concepts
    intersect at the point where we need to locate an item at a specific moment in
    time and that this is a good starting point for the conversation about how to
    make things easier to find. We Are Broken, Not Them - A response to Karen Schneider&rsquo;s

  content: "From a avid user of libraries for research and pleasure, <strong>I now
    find the online catalogs a pain</strong>. I used to be able to look something
    up and find related books in one-fourth the time it now takes on computers, using
    the old fashioned card catalogs. \n\nTo my dismay my libraries are getting rid
    of these paper records. Why have the libraries done this? Now there is no going
    back, and no backup if all their systems crash and burn. Could happen, what if
    a solar flare burns up all our electrical systems?\n\nThere is ONE good use for
    these really slow computer catalogs, if you're online! and not IN the library.\n\nWhen
    I want to find something now, after a few minutes on the computer catalog and
    finding the sections my topic is in, I just go to the stacks and look at the books
    shelved together. Course you don't always find all the related books you want
    that way. But it is sometimes faster than using the computer. And that may be
    a major cause of declining use of the digital catalogs. They are not effective
    or quick. \n\nIf you can't find what you want in the library, guess what? You
    go back to the internet cause you can find it faster there! Another reason for
    the decline in use of the library itelf may be that they are getting rid of too
    many books! \n\nI found you on favorite.me and am going to fave you.\nBut this
    is intriguing as I never would have found you otherwise and I am ready to give
    user input to librarians about this issue. So what if kids don't have a clue?
    Teach them. They learn fast if they want to. If you don't surrender to the fads
    yourselves.\n\nWhat do you have to say to users like me who are totally unhappy
    with the new digital catalogs? And the new library policies?\n\nBill Gates was
    totally wrong about \"Business at the Speed of Thought.\" It ain't.\nDo check
    out my attempts at scholarliness and some fun from all the research that went
    into my novel about King Tut:\nat http://blog.talesofkingtut.com\n\nWhat is this

  content: "Rene --\r\n\r\nOut of curiosity, do you use Amazon.com or BarnesAndNoble.com
    to look for books?  Does that user interface work better for you than the typical
    library catalog?  There is a growing contingent in the library profession that
    are seeking to apply the techniques and technologies in those book store catalogs
    to our library catalogs.  (For example, the <a href=\"http://www.aadl.org/catalog\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">Ann Arbor (MI) District Library</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/catalog/\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">North Carolina State University Library</a>, and the <a href=\"http://gapines.org/opac/en-US/skin/default/xml/index.xml\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">Georgia PINES service</a>.)\r\n\r\nI don't think the economics
    of printing, shipping, filing, unfiling, and shifting physical cards are viable
    anymore.    Last year, OCLC produced 2.6 million physical cards ((<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20070704162855/http://www.oclc.org/news/publications/annualreports/2006/2006.pdf\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">OCLC 2006 Annual Report</a>, page 8)) down from 25.1 million
    cards a year in 1996  ((<a href=\"http://digitalarchive.oclc.org/da/ViewObject.jsp?objid=0000004071\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">OCLC 1995-1996 annual report</a>)) and 2.2 million catalog cards
    each week in 1980 ((Headline of <a href=\"http://www.oclc.org/news/publications/newsletters/newsletter_index.htm\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">May 1980 OCLC Newsletter</a> No. 129)).  Library automation started
    with back-room functions &mdash; the printing of cards along with acquisitions,
    serials control, and circulation; the public interface to the electronic holdings
    of the library was historically one of the last modules to be developed.\r\n\r\nI
    have no doubt that you find the existing catalog interfaces cumbersome and awkward.
    \ Usability testing tells us that they fail.  It could be argued that it is easier
    to perform the kinds of serendipitous discovery you were describing using the
    online catalog; there are more access points with which to browse now &mdash;
    all of the subject headings (not just the first one or two or three), all of the
    additional authors and alternate titles, and even a \"shelf browse\" based on
    call number order.\r\n\r\nProper computer system maintenance is a concern, and
    the professionals running the library catalog should be following best practices
    for off-site storage of backup tapes and regularly testing the backup media.  (I
    don't share your concern for solar flares &mdash; if we have solar flares big
    enough to wipe out library computer systems then we're going to have much bigger
    problems on our hands.)\r\n\r\nLibraries serve at the pleasure of their patrons.
    \ If the computer system at your local library is too slow and/or its collection
    policies mean that it is getting rid of too many books, I'd encourage your to
    voice your opinion to the leadership of your library.  Just please be aware that
    the economics of asking for more books (which take up more space) and the physical
    card catalog (which also takes up a great deal of space) may be diametrically
    opposed.\r\n\r\nAs for myself, I can only speak first hand about two libraries.
    \ First is <a href=\"http://www.ohiolink.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">my employer</a>
    &mdash; where we engage daily with our consortium members (academic libraries)
    and suppliers (publishers) to maximize the utility of money spent for raw content
    and the delivery systems used by our patrons.  Second is <a href=\"http://columbuslibrary.org/\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">my public library</a> where I and my family (especially the five-year-old)
    are quite happy with the level of service on most accounts.  (\"most\" because
    their catalog interface needs quite a bit of work, too.)\r\n\r\nThanks for the
    conversation starter.  Feel free to continue.  The Wordpress plug-in generating
    the comment preview is <a href=\"http://dev.wp-plugins.org/wiki/LiveCommentPreview\"

<p>In academic libraries, in my experience, there has been a decline in the use of library catalogs.  This experience could be verified in the ARL supplementary statistics for at least that population of libraries (I think those numbers are password-protected, so it might be a challenge to try to use them).  When I get back on the ground and have some time, I will either offer confirmation of that supposition or retract it.</p>
<p>I will dismiss the notion of asking reference librarians how they see users using the catalog because they are too close to the issue.  I believe, to use a phrase from Clayton Christensen's <i>Innovator's Dilemma</i>, that the library community is facing <strong>disruptive innovation</strong> &mdash; the first it has had to deal with in quite some time.  And, according to Christensen's model, one of the traps encountered when faced with disruptive innovation is listening too closely to customers (implying here that reference librarians are one of the key customers of the catalog).  Listening to customers tends to drive a product into "performance oversupply" with lots of features and tweaks that most customers don't really want yet still pay for because there is not yet an alternative.  The suppliers are acting rationally, too &mdash; after all, what supplier wouldn't want to meet all of the desires of its squeakiest wheels?</p>
<p>I ask you &mdash; does that sound at all like your most favorite (or least favorite, as the case might be) OPAC supplier?  Therein lies the trap -- not only for libraries but also for the library software vendors.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Listening to ourselves (librarians in general) is what is getting us into this situation in the first place. We keep focusing on increasingly small improvements with a relatively low return on investment while users of a whole new modality of communication (call it "Web 2.0", if you will) look over their shoulder (if we&rsquo;re lucky) and wonder why we&rsquo;re not keeping up.
</p></blockquote>
<p>You stated: "I frankly find it unbelievable that OPACs aren&rsquo;t being used. Of course they are."  Agreed.  They are being used.  OPACs are very effective at figuring out whether your library has a known item as well as what titles your library holds by a known author.</p>
<p>You asked: "Are they being used as often or in the ways librarians might like them to be?"  Well, I don't know about the profession in general but I'm guessing not because instructional sessions surrounding the use of the catalog continue (again, primarily in the academic library space) and even librarians will admit to using Amazon or BN.com or the like to find an item they are looking for.</p>
<p>[Since you are not running an OPAC, Walt, I suspect these three questions will have to be in the abstract for you (should you choose to comment).]  I'll ask: "Are they being used as effectively as they could be?"  And related: "Does their current use justify their on-going expense?"  And lastly:  "When is the last time someone thanked you for a new feature you worked hard to get into your system?"  If it has been too long, what should we do about it?</p>
