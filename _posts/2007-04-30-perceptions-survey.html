  content: "Is it a problem in _marketing_ what we're doing, or is it a problem in
    \r\n_what we're doing_? Are we doing what we should be in the first place? I couldn't
    really answer that survey, because I'm not sure we are. \r\n\r\nA marketing problem
    is when people don't realize what we're doing. Not if they correctly realize what
    we're doing/not doing, but we wish we were doing something different. That's not
    a marketing problem."

  content: "I think it is a little bit of both, and the survey will ferret that out.
    \ It asks not only about others perceptions of librarians, but librarians' perceptions
    about themselves.  Public librarians, for instance, continue to shatter my stereotyping
    of them as \"not with it\" -- I can't remember if the survey provided a way to
    break down along those demographic lines, but the results could be interesting.\r\n\r\nThen
    there are those that don't seem to be doing the right things anymore.  A colleague
    had a phrase for that -- \"Change, one funeral at a time.\""

<p><a href="http://wikis.ala.org/emergingleaders/index.php/User:Jemanuel" title="Jenny Emanuel&#039;s page on ALA Emerging Leaders site">Jenny Emanuel</a>, Electronic Services Librarian at University of Central Missouri, posted an invitation to complete a survey on how library professionals think of themselves to several mailing lists.  As part of the <a href="http://wikis.ala.org/emergingleaders/index.php/Main_Page" title="Emerging Leaders homepage">ALA Emerging Leaders 2007 program</a>, she is part of a team look for options on <a href="http://wikis.ala.org/emergingleaders/index.php/Project_KK" title="Emerging Leaders Project KK description">rebranding the librarian profession in the digital world</a>.  This looks like it will have interesting results; if you consider yourself a "library professional" take the survey yourself:  <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.asp?u=371423757475" title="Librarian Perceptions survey">http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.asp?u=371423757475</a>.</p>
<p>Out of all of the questions, number 10 struck me as the heart of the matter:</p>
<blockquote><p>10. How strongly do you agree with the following statements?</p>
<ul>
<li>Librarians excel in customer service. </li>
<li>Librarians are on the cutting edge of the publishing industry.</li>
<li>Librarians are experts at designing databases and special computer resources.</li>
<li>Librarians assist people in learning new technologies. </li>
<li>Librarians wear cardigans and glasses.</li>
<li>Librarians are experts at exploiting the Internet.</li>
<li>Librarians are on the cutting edge of technology tools (i.e. blogs, wikis, podcasts). </li>
<li>Librarians are highly educated professionals.</li>
<li>Librarians need to do a better job of marketing themselves. </li>
<li>Librarians need a new image for the digital age. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I did have philosophical differences with question #13:</p>
<blockquote><p>13. Please fill in the blanks in the sentence:</p>
<p>Only a librarian can deliver _____ to _____.</p></blockquote>
<p>I couldn't get past the mental image of librarian-as-gatekeeper.  I could answer the question "only a <em>library</em> can deliver..." &mdash; but that is an entirely different question.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, I also had a problem answering question #2:</p>
<blockquote><p>Would you describe yourself as a librarian?</p></blockquote>
<p>I think I used to be a librarian &mdash; primarily at a time before I had a library degree.  Now I think I'm a 'library technologist' &mdash; working on the application of technology in the library arena.  Since working in a consortial office puts me at some distance from actual users, I'm not sure I can claim the title 'librarian' any more.</p>
<p>Interesting questions, no?  Then go <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.asp?u=371423757475" title="Librarian Perceptions survey">take the survey yourself</a>.  The results will be presented in a poster session at ALA Annual on Friday, June 23.</p>
