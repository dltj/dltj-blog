  content: Dear Jester, every time you add to this blog, all of your posts refresh
    in my aggregator. Is that intentional--do you want me to re-read them? ;-) Do
    keep posting... I'm mesmerized that Google, the most un-open of vendors, is underwriting
    a Summer of Luv for open source, but hey! Why not.

  content: "You can keep re-reading them only if they are good.  I'm not quite sure
    what is causing the refresh problem (what are you using as an aggregator?).  I
    must admit that I don't read my own blog in my newsreader-of-choice (<span class=\"removed_link\"
    title=\"http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/\">NetNewsWire</span> on the Mac).  I'll
    set up a feed, though, and take a look.\r\n\r\nCome to think of it, I did uninstall
    a bunch of WordPress extensions because they were causing the page XHTML validation
    to fail.  That probably mucked with the content somewhat and caused some date
    or checksum to change.  I'll try to stop doing that.  ;-)"
