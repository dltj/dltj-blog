At some point the DRC will need a generalized peer review system.&nbsp; Although I'm not sure we will use OAI-PMH to shepherd the results around various systems, there are som good ideas here about how to create an open peer review system.</p>
<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0504084v3">The Convergence of Digital-Libraries and the Peer-Review Process</a> <br />Authors: Marko A. Rodriguez, Johan Bollen, Herbert Van de Sompel <br />Journal of Information Science [in press]</p>
<blockquote><p>Pre-print repositories have seen a significant increase in use over the past fifteen years across multiple research domains. Researchers are beginning to develop applications capable of using these repositories to assist the scientific community above and beyond the pure dissemination of information. The contribution set forth by this paper emphasizes a deconstructed publication model in which the peer-review process is mediated by an OAI-PMH peer-review service. This peer-review service uses a social-network algorithm to determine potential reviewers for a submitted manuscript and for weighting the relative influence of each participating reviewer's evaluations. This paper also suggests a set of peer-review specific metadata tags that can accompany a pre-print's existing metadata record. The combinations of these contributions provide a unique repository-centric peer-review model that fits within the widely deployed OAI-PMH framework.</p></blockquote>
