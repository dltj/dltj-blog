  content: "NSF&rsquo;s increased involvement in the digital preservation arena should
    bring with it NSF&rsquo;s strong, science-oriented approach towards exploring
    this topic. In his work &ldquo;Image and Logic: A Material Culture of Microphysics,&rdquo;
    the historian of Science Peter Galison argues that modern Physics now rests on
    three pillars - theory, experiment, and simulation. Much of what is taken as digital
    preservation system design and development has proceeded from - at best - a largely
    theoretical base. This would include the design of Digital Item packaging structures
    and the retention and use of legacy multimedia data formats.\r\n\r\nShould Galison&rsquo;s
    other two legs of experimentation and simulation be brought to bear on digital
    preservation issues, I definitely hope to see prospective research groups develop:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>A
    real simulation of an Open Archival Information System (using tools like Isee
    Systems&rsquo; STELLA or iThink), in order to examine the full system consequences
    of OAIS design choices like using uncompressed multimedia files, or the use of
    &ldquo;scalable media&rdquo; to fully implement the OAIS &ldquo;Generate DIP&rdquo;
    function instead of offloading aspects of that function to institutional intermediaries
    or to the end-user.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>A real program of experimentation to explore
    the effect of individual and group differences on things like image and audio
    quality judgments and preferences. Present practice is for Cultural Heritage gatekeepers
    in constrained situations to judge/declare image/audio quality levels on behalf
    of end-users. However, the least bit of research into visual discrimination tasks
    indicates that large differences in, for example, image viewing can exist as a
    function of factors like visual arts training.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>A Sociological
    or Communication-Theoretic study of Cultural Heritage institutions as elements
    of a global communication network. Especially interesting would be: an analysis
    of CH institution&rsquo;s communication and control structures - and their behind-the-scenes
    social network; and a &ldquo;Diffusion of Innovation&rdquo; analysis of which
    technologies are/are not adopted.</li>\r\n</ul>"

  content: "If you're not careful, Ron, some version of your thoughts might make their
    way into a proposal somewhere.  ;-)\r\n\r\nMy read of the program solicitation
    is that there is a strong desire for successful proposals to bring in practitioners
    from the field in question.  Another part of the solicitation indicates that successful
    applications will \"Possess expertise in library and archival sciences; computer,
    computational, and information sciences; cyberinfrastructure; and domain sciences.
    Integrate this expertise into a single, functional unit through an organizational
    structure that enables shared responsibility, close coordination and cooperation,
    and catalyzes the exchange of ideas.\"\r\n\r\nOne difficult part may be for \"cultural
    heritage gatekeepers\" to break out of their traditional roles.  It would seem
    like the program statement is written to ensure that happens."

<p>The past few weeks have seen announcements of large digital preservation programs.  I find it interesting that the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/" title="US National Science Foundation homepage">National Science Foundation</a> is involved in both of them.</p>
<h2>Sustainable Digital Data Preservation and Access Network Partners</h2>
<p>The NSF's <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/dir/index.jsp?org=OCI" title="nsf.gov - Office of  Cyberinfrastructure (US National Science Foundation) homepage">Office of  Cyberinfrastructure</a> has announced a request for proposals with the name <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503141" title="Sustainable Digital Data Preservation and Access Network Partners funding announcement">Sustainable Digital Data Preservation and Access Network Partners&nbsp;(DataNet)</a>.  The lead paragraph of its synopsis is:</p>
<blockquote><p>Science and engineering research and education are increasingly digital and increasingly data-intensive.  Digital data are not only the output of research but provide input to new hypotheses, enabling new scientific insights and driving innovation. Therein lies one of the major challenges of this scientific generation: how to develop the new methods, management structures and technologies to manage the diversity, size, and complexity of current and future data sets and data streams.  This solicitation addresses that challenge by creating a set of exemplar national and global data research infrastructure organizations (dubbed DataNet Partners) that provide unique opportunities to communities of researchers to advance science and/or engineering research and learning.</p></blockquote>
<p>The introduction in the solicitation goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>Chapter 3 (Data, Data Analysis, and Visualization) of <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2007/nsf0728/index.jsp" title="US NSF 07-28, Cyberinfrastructure Vision for 21st Century Discovery">NSF&rsquo;s Cyberinfrastructure Vision for 21<sup>st</sup> Century Discovery</a> presents a vision in which &ldquo;science and engineering digital data are routinely deposited in well-documented form, are regularly and easily consulted and analyzed by specialists and non-specialists alike, are openly accessible while suitably protected, and are reliably preserved.&rdquo; The goal of this solicitation is to catalyze the development of a system of science and engineering data collections that is open, extensible and evolvable.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf07601" title="Publication nsf07601: Sustainable Digital Data Preservation and Access Network Partners program solicitation">full program solicitation</a> is available (here's a hint if the left side of the PDF version is cut off when printing -- in the Acrobat print dialog, reduce the document size to 94% of the paper size).  There will be up to five awards of $20 million each for five years with the possibility of continuing funding.</p>
<p>The part that I find interesting, from a library technologist's perspective, is this:  "Successfully providing stability for long-term preservation and agility both to embrace constant technological change and to engage evolving research challenges requires a novel combination of expertise in library and archival sciences, computer, computational, and information sciences, cyberinfrastructure, and the other domain sciences and engineering.  A goal of this solicitation is to support the creation of new types of organizations that fully integrate all of these capabilities."  Undertaking such an endeavor must be a truly cross-discipline attempt -- marrying up the best of library and archive practices with other forms of science and engineering to accomplish the task.</p>
<p>It would seem that the Fedora Commons platform is a great starting point for the technological infrastructure.  It is as if the solicitation could have been written with Fedora in mind:  "content heterogeneity requires that each awardee create a resource that serves a broad disciplinary and subject matter range, manages a diverse array of data types and formats, and provides the capability to support collections at the research, resource, and reference levels."  Another component of the program goals -- developing models for economic and technological sustainability -- is similar to OhioLINK's attempts to aggregate the creation and support of content repositories at state-wide economies of scale.</p>
<p>Peter Brantley, Executive Director of the Digital Library Federation, has established a <a href="http://network.nature.com/group/datanet" title="NSF DataNet in groups on Nature Network">group</a> on Nature's Network service for those who want to collaborate or get further information (open to participation from anyone, but registration is required).  There is a kernel of a group in Ohio that are considering the possibility of a joint application; if interested, please let me know.  Peter also has a <span class="removed_link" title="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/09/a_national_data.html">post on the topic on O'Reilly's Radar</span>.</p>
<h2>Blue Ribbon Task Force on Sustainable Digital Preservation and Access</h2>
<p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation are funding a blue-ribbon task force to address the issue of economic sustainability for digital preservation and persistent access.  Co-chaired by <a href="http://www.sdsc.edu/News%20Items/PR091907_blueribbon.html" title="Fran Berman of the San Diego Supercomputer Center&#039; press release">Fran Berman of the San Diego Supercomputer Center</a> and <a href="http://www.oclc.org/news/releases/200673.htm" title="Task force on economic sustainability of digital data&#039; press release">Brian Lavoie of OCLC</a>, the task force will meet with over the next two years to look at the issue.  It is intended as an international effort; <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/news/stories/2007/09/pres" title="Task force to address sustainability in digital preservation&#039; press release">support is also coming from JISC</a> in the U.K.</p>
<blockquote><p>In its final report, the Task Force is charged with developing a comprehensive analysis of current issues, and actionable recommendations for the future to catalyze the development of sustainable resource strategies for the reliable preservation of digital information.  During its tenure, the Task Force also will produce a series of articles about the challenges and opportunities of digital information preservation, for both the scholarly community and the public. ((From the <a href="http://www.oclc.org/news/releases/200673.htm" title="">OCLC press release</a>.))</p></blockquote>
<p>The only news so far appears to be the press releases linked above.  Now I recognize it is a two year effort and they only got started late last month, but I half expect some public face to the work of the task force to be available somewhere, even in the early stages.  If <i>DLTJ</i> readers see anything, please mention it in this posting's comments.
