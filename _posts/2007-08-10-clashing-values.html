  content: "[quote comment=\"20402\"]I don't think you could be more wrong about BMC,
    and I am puzzled as to why you would link my post in that context.  My point was
    basically that BMC's pricing is far from unreasonable.[/quote]\r\n\r\nI linked
    to your post because I believe it shows how BMC is exhibiting values more characteristic
    of a business and less like an academic institution.  In particular, I would point
    to this paragraph:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The increased cost arises because Yale researchers
    are submitting more and more work to BMC journals.  More manuscripts = higher
    costs, but if the cost per article has not gone up, then BMC's model scales effectively.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nIf
    BMC's model were to truly scale effectively and represent real costs, the more
    manuscripts would represent a <em>lower cost per article</em> as the fixed costs
    of the publishing activity are spread out over more articles.  That they do not
    (and in their blog posting suggest other ways of covering the costs) would seem
    to hint at some other variable hidden from public view.  In the business arena,
    that might be called a \"profit margin\" -- in this case, I don't know what to
    call it, but it does seem to exist.\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention to suggest that
    open access models are wrong -- quite to the contrary, I'm an open access proponent.
    \ I do suggest, however, that BMC's model may be more in line with traditional
    business values than traditional academic values, and that is something to be
    aware of as a academic community so we are not surprised by it later down the
    line.  (Or that we work collectively to change the underlying values.)"

  content: "<blockquote>If BMC&rsquo;s model were to truly scale effectively and represent
    real costs, the more manuscripts would represent a <i>lower cost per article</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nAh,
    I see your point (though I think that more ms submissions means higher costs to
    the publisher, too, so cost/article would only drop as economies of scale came
    into play and could be passed on to consumers).\r\n\r\nI have never objected to
    for-profit publishing <i>per se</i>, but <a href=\"http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6431958.html\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">average profit margins of 25%</a> and a rate of serials price
    increase <a href=\"http://www.unc.edu/scholcomdig/whitepapers/panitch-michalak.html\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">around three times the CPI increase</a> start to make me suspect
    I'm being ripped off.  \r\n\r\nSo you're right, it's worth remembering that BMC
    <i>is</i> a business, and I'd be curious to know what their profit margin is.
    \   \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, what numbers I can find indicate that the academic
    community could support commercial OA publishers at no greater expense than the
    traditional model, and perhaps significant savings, while gaining the considerable
    benefits of OA.  Hence my defense of BMC.<p style=\"padding:0;margin:0;font-style:italic;\">The

<p>This posting has two goals -- first, to introduce <acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester"><i>DLTJ</i></acronym> readers to the notion of "Educational Patents" or "edupatents" and provide an update on events of this week.  Second, to frame the sometimes contentious interaction between academic institutions and supporting businesses as one of "clashing values."  The former serves as a cautionary tale within the wider scope of the latter.<br />
<!--break--></p>
<h2>Educational Patents</h2>
<p>Are you following the world of "edupatents" (<a href="http://www.mfeldstein.com/edupatents/" title="EduPatents at e-Literate">broadly defined</a> as patents that affect the educational markets)?  This kicked into gear about this time last year with <a href="http://www.blackboard.com/" title="Blackboard homepage">Blackboard</a>'s <a href="http://www.immagic.com/eLibrary/ARCHIVES/GENERAL/USCOURTS/T060726C.pdf" title="Full text of Blackboard v. Desire2Learn">lawsuit</a> [PDF] against <a href="http://desire2learn.com/" title="Desire2Learn homepage">Desire2Learn</a> over <a href="http://www.blackboard.com/About-Bb/Patents/Frequently-Asked-Questions.aspx" title="Blackboard&#039;s Patent Lawsuit FAQ">alleged infringements</a> by Desire2Learn of <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&#038;Sect2=HITOFF&#038;d=PALL&#038;p=1&#038;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&#038;r=1&#038;f=G&#038;l=50&#038;s1=6,988,138.PN.&#038;OS=PN/6,988,138&#038;RS=PN/6,988,138" title="U.S. Patent number 6,988,138 for &#039;Internet-based education support system and methods&#039;">a Blackboard patent</a>.  Michael Feldstein posted <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/the_blackboard_patent_claims_in_plain_english/" title="&#039;The Blackboard Patent Claims in Plain English&#039; in e-Literate">a layman's analysis of the lawsuit</a> and concludes that many "Learning Management Systems have most or all of the features listed in the claims and therefore may infringe on the patent."  Those in the list are not only Desire2Learn and other commercial packages, but also the open source <a href="https://www.sakaiproject.org/" title="Sakai Project homepage">Sakai</a> and <a href="https://moodle.org/" title="Moodle homepage">Moodle</a> projects.  Al Essa has a <a href="http://tatler.typepad.com/nose/2006/08/how_to_think_ab_3.html" title="&#039;How to Think About the Blackboard Patent. Part III. What did Blackboard Invent?&#039; at The NOSE: Information Technology in Higher Education">graphical view of Blackboard's patent claims</a>, and it does seem that the patent covers a broad spectrum of educational technologies that we are starting to take for granted.</p>
<p>The end of last year was a very busy time in the world of edupatents.  In early October 2006, the EDUCAUSE board issued a <a href="http://www.educause.edu/library/resources/educause-board-letter-blackboard" title="EDUCAUSE Board Letter to Blackboard">statement denouncing the lawsuit</a> followed by events in December at the Sakai conference in Atlanta: <span class="removed_link" title="http://issues.sakaiproject.org/confluence/download/attachments/34226/2006_12_06_Keynote_Eben_Moglen.mp3">Eben Moglen's (of the Software Freedom Law Center) keynote speech on the dangers of edupatents</span> [MP3] and <a title="Eben Moglen v. Matthew Small at the Sakai Conference in Atlanta, December 2006" href="http://issues.sakaiproject.org/confluence/display/CONF06/Lunchtime+Discussion+with+Eben+Moglen+and+Matthew+Small">a debate between Eben Moglen and  Matthew Small (Blackboard's chief council)</a> on the merits of Blackboard's case.  (I highly recommend listening to both recordings.)  All of this was followed by news earlier this year from the combined EDUCAUSE and Sakai boards of a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071015074535/http://connect.educause.edu:80/blog/cluckett/importantannouncemen/16765" title="EDUCAUSE-Sakai Statement on Blackboard Patent Pledge">negotiated non-aggression pact</a> between Blackboard and the open source community.</p>
<p>Just this week the story got even more interesting.  First, <a href="http://community.desire2learn.com/d2l/lms/blog/view_userentry.d2l?ou=1796&#038;ownerId=6961&#038;entryId=178&#038;ec=1&#038;iu=1&#038;sp=&#038;gb=usr" title="Desire2Learn&#039;s patent response blog">Desire2Learn reported on a major decision by the court</a> in the Blackboard lawsuit:  "Claim 1 is rendered invalid because of indefiniteness. Further, all dependent claims that rely on Claim 1 (in our case, Claims 2 through 35) are similarly invalid."  That leaves only Claims 36 through 44 in play.  Second, Blackboard file a "preemptive" <a href="http://www.immagic.com/eLibrary/ARCHIVES/GENERAL/USCOURTS/C070803C.pdf" title="Full text of Blackboard v. iParadigms">lawsuit</a> against <a href="http://turnitin.com/" title="http://turnitin.com/">Turnitin</a> (Internet-based plagiarism-detection service) that seeks to prevent Turnitin's parent company <a href="http://www.iparadigms.com/" title="iParadigms homepage">iParadigms</a> from suing Blackboard over potential claims that Blackboard may have violated iParadigms' patents (a <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/In-Preemptive-Action/122899/" title="&#039;In &#039;Preemptive Action,&#039; Blackboard Sues Turnitin Over Patent Dispute&#039; by Dan Carnevale in Chronicle of Higher Education, 10-Aug-2007">story from Chronicle of Higher Education</a> [subscription required], <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/update-on-blackboard-v-turnitin/" title="&#039;Update on Blackboard v Turnitin&#039; in e-Literate">Michael Feldstein's analysis</a> and <a href="http://tatler.typepad.com/docs/iparadigmspress.pdf" title="Press Release by iParadigms">iParadigms' view</a>).</p>
<p>How does this apply to academic libraries?  In describing the Blackboard versus Desire2Learn lawsuit, <a href="http://tatler.typepad.com/nose/2006/08/how_to_think_ab_2.html" title="&#039;The NOSE: Information Technology in Higher Education: How to Think About the Blackboard Patent: Part II.  What is the Scope of Blackboard&#039;s Patent?">Al Essa proposes</a>:  "In addition to the core technologies associated with a [Virtual Learning Environment], the Blackboard patent potentially covers any infrastructure and integration elements when used in the context of course delivery."  Could that cover our online course reserve systems?  Or our portals for delivering electronic materials to online classroom environments?  It may apply directly to our services.</p>
<h2>Open Access Journals</h2>
<p>Closer to home is the <span class="removed_link" title="http://www2.library.yale.edu/movabletype/scilib/archive/2007/08/library_drops_b_1.html">recent announcement by the science and medical libraries of Yale University</span> to discontinue their subsidy of author charges for BioMed Central journals.  To me, <a href="http://blogs.openaccesscentral.com/blogs/bmcblog/entry/yale_and_open_access_publishing" title="&#039;Yale and open access publishing - a response from BioMed Central&#039; in BioMed Central blog">BioMed Central's response</a> speaks volumes for how they view themselves -- more aligned with the values of the business community than that of the educational community.  This may explain some of <a href="http://sennoma.net/?p=536" title="Open Reading Frame">the</a> <a href="http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/08/05/yale-university-drops-biomed-central-membership" title="&#039;Yale University drops Biomed Central membership - Publish or Perish 2.0&#039; in Martin Fenner&#039;s blog on Nature Network">reaction</a> <a href="http://digital-scholarship.org/digitalkoans/2007/08/05/yale-cancels-biomed-central-membership/" title="&#039;Yale Cancels BioMed Central Membership&#039; in DigitalKoans">that</a> <a href="http://oedb.org/blogs/wideopen/2007/biomed-central-reponds-to-yale/" title="&#039;BioMed Central reponds to Yale&#039; in Wide Open Education">we</a> have been seeing to the announcement.</p>
<p>[20070812T1930 update:  Please note that the first link in the last sentence points to a posting by Bill Hooker in his Open Reading Frame blog about the economics of BMC's publishing model.  Bill is decidedly pro-Open Access -- as am I -- and we have a running discussion in the commentary of this posting on <acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester"><i>DLTJ</i></acronym>.]</p>
<h2>Clashing Values</h2>
<p>I think we have examples of clashing values -- the values of the higher education community and the values of the business community.  The values that drive the latter are characteristically geared towards profit-seeking for shareholders and others with a financial interest in the business.  The values of the former tend to be towards collegial cooperation.  Please note that I'm attempting to use terms that are not inherently loaded with statements of the merit of these values.  Instead note the disconnect between drivers of the educational and business communities.  I think it is this disconnect that cause those in the educational community to react so negatively to the actions of those in the business community (be they lawsuits over patents or inflationary increases in journal pricing).  After all, if you are at an academic institution, do you want to see your license and maintenance dollars go to funding lawsuits against competitors?  In analyzing Blackboard's actions, some have speculated that this is what can happen when a technology company runs out of intellectual capital -- it has to resort to lawsuits to hold off competitors, paralyze the open source community, remain profitable, and stay afloat.  Are there library technology vendors in a similar predicament?</p>
<p>So here's the point:  I propose that it is further evidence that we need to <a href="http://dltj.org/2006/02/our-destiny/" title="Where have all the programmers gone? Taking command of our destiny&#039; in DLTJ">take control of our destiny</a>.  Not to spell out a doom-and-gloom scenario, but there may be a "perfect storm" brewing in the consolidation of the integrated library system vendors, <span class="removed_link" title="http://blogs.ala.org/pace.php?title=vista_acquisition_of_sirsidynix_complete&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1">the entrance of venture capital into the ILS market place</span> (and the corresponding expectations for profitability), and the rise of open source options to the traditional vendor-supplied ILS.  None of the ILS vendors appear to be striking out with lawsuits like Blackboard has done.  A spirited discussion could be had on whether the ILS vendors are pricing their products in an unrealistic way (as with the BioMed Central example).  In any case, it would be in the best interest of the students and faculty that we represent to be mindful of these clashing values. While it is important to be respectful of the traditional values of the business community with whom we interact, it is even more important to act in a manner consistent with the values of our traditional academic community with which we are a part.</p>
