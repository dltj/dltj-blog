  content: '<!--%kramer-ref-pre%-->[...] Implementations of JPEG 2000 have been increasing
    steadily during 2005 and 2006. Michael Gormish, as part of his Gormish Notes on
    JPEG2000, now maintains a small "wiki" for his tracking of JPEG2000 adoption [http://www.crc.ricoh.com/~gormish/jpeg2000adoption.html],
    rather than a single page, because developments to record are increasingly frequent.
    Most image manipulation programs and software libraries can now read and write
    JP2 files. JPEG2000 encoder chips are available, e.g., from Analog Devices and
    ALMA Technologies. Software encoders designed for general DSP (digital signal
    processing) chips are available from other manufacturers, e.g., Texas Instruments.
    Examples of significant adoption of JPEG2000 in commercial or government application
    sectors include: the Digital Cinema Initiative (see Digital Cinema Initiative
    Package (DCP), Version 1.0); use by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment
    (HiRISE) flying on board NASA''s MARS Reconnaissance Orbiter mission; and use
    in the stock photography service AbsolutVision. Use of JPEG 2000 in medical and
    geospatial imaging applications is growing steadily. For example, in late 2006,
    lossless JPEG 2000 was proposed as the standard for compressed imagery in the
    Western Australia Land Information System in a report that considers adoption
    in GIS communitities in some detail [http://www.walis.wa.gov.au/projects/JPEG2000/JP2K_Report_for_DLI_v1.0.pdf].
    Security cameras that use JPEG2000 for compression are on the market, e.g., from
    Sanyo. Another specialist camera system with built-in JPEG2000, from Air Resource
    Specialists, Inc. is for monitoring air-quality. Many cultural heritage institutions,
    including the Library of Congress, that had used MrSID to support zoom views of
    large images such as maps, have migrated to using JPEG 2000 as a service format.
    Minutes of the ALA/LITA JPEG2000 Interest Group meeting in June 2006 indicated
    usage by several participants: Western Michigan University is using JPEG2000 for
    access to digitized manuscripts; LexisNexis is using JPEG2000 in the maps portion
    of the U.S. Serials Set digitization program; the Smithsonian Libraries has started
    converting archival TIFFs to JPEG2000 and is considering use of the standard in
    the Biodiversity Heritage Library project. There was also discussion of the state
    of support for JPEG2000 in software systems used by libraries. Insight (Luna)
    ContentDM (DiMeMa), and Digitool (Ex Libris) can now use JPEG2000 and have deployed
    server-side transformation to deliver an image to the user within a regular web-browser.   In
    early 2007, some commentators on the Web called attention to the fact that JPEG
    2000 encoding is not being built into camera chips nor is JPEG 2000 decoding native
    to Web browsers. This has led them to compare the adoption of the format in unfavorable
    terms to JPEG_DCT, the earlier JPEG codec, which is native to virtually all digital
    cameras and browsers. Earlier indications of adoption were: The Guide to the Practical
    Implementation of JPEG 2000 (2003, see Useful references below), reports that
    "Some of the aerial photography on the street-mapping web site MapQuest.com is
    provided by a JPEG 2000 back-end system, chosen for its ability to extract small
    regions from very large images at high speed. Yahoo! Messenger, an instant-messaging
    client with video capabilities, also uses JPEG 2000, to achieve high compression
    and hence higher resolution and frame-rate. In both cases, the use of JPEG 2000
    is not typically manifest to the end-user." See also Peter Murray''s presentation
    Adoption of JPEG 2000 by Libraries and Archives. &nbsp;&nbsp;Licensing and patent
    claimsLicensing is associated with the encoding; see J2K_C. TransparencySee J2K_C
    Self-documentationA small set of metadata is required: basic image data (height,
    width, number of components, bit-depth); color specification (see notes on color
    maintenance below), and a flag indicating the presence or absence of intellectual
    property information. This may be supplemented by optional information, e.g.,
    capture or dispay resolution (relating pixel size to physical size) and by data
    presented in three optional boxes: (1) a box for XML data (specific recommendations
    regarding XML are provided in Part 2 of the standard and pertain to JPX but may
    be used in JP2 as well), (2) an IPR box (see technical protection considerations
    just below), and (3) a UUID box which provides for an object identifier or identifier-references
    to other digital objects (described by one commentator as providing a generic
    mechanism for extending the file format to include application-specific data).
    External dependenciesNone Technical protection considerationsLike the rest of
    the members of the JPEG 2000 file format family, JP2_FF provides an IPR box for
    rights management information that may be used as inputs to access management
    systems. [...]<!--%kramer-ref-post%-->'

<p>Attending:  M. Anderson, U of Iowa; A. Laas, LexisNexis; Y. Han, U of Arizona; P. Howell, Western Michigan University;  Y. Kaganovia, Princeton U; P. Murray, OhioLINK; K. Thompson, Smithsonian Libraries</p>
<p>Participants talked about their interest in JPEG2000 and their institution's use of the standard:  Western Michgan University is digitizing manuscripts and other special collections materials and using JPEG2000 for access; LexisNexis is using JPEG2000 in the maps portion of the U.S. Serials Set digitization program; the Smithsonian Libraries has started converting archival TIFFs to JPEG2000 and is considering use of the standard in the Biodiversity Heritage Library project (including a capability to cross-link taxonomic names in digitized text to oneline databases).</p>
<p>There was discussion of the state of JPEG2000 in library systems.  Companies such as Luna ("Insight"), DiMeMa ("ContentDM"), Ex Libris ("Digitool") now use JPEG2000 in their back-end systems and use some sort of server-side transformation to deliver an image to the user.  Peter spoke of the Google Summer of Code project to build a JPIP applet in Java that could be embedded in web pages to do the panning and zooming on the client side rather than the server side.</p>
<h2>Ideas for Programming</h2>
<p>Meeting participants appreciated the "Introduction to JPEG2000" presentation last year and would like to see an update on how the standard is being used in practice.  Possible topics included bringing in representatives from the medical imaging and motion picture industry to talk about the use of JPEG2000 in DICOM and the Digital Cinema Initiative to get a sense of how the standard is used outside of libraries and archives.  Other suggested topics included updates on the standardization of the various parts through the ISO process, presentations by vendors on their use of the standard in their products, and demonstrations by practitioners of the standard.</p>
