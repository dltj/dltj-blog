<p>Two items of recent note in the JPEG2000 world.  The first is the <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/google/20080103005812/en" title="Press release">announcement of "the world&rsquo;s first fully integrated wireless HDTV</a>" that uses JPEG2000 over the air:<br />
<blockquote>The High Definition LCD TV, featuring Pulse~LINK&rsquo;s integrated CWave&reg; UWB Wireless HDMI technology, will be on display for the first time at the 2008 International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada, January 7-10. [...] With the integration of CWave&reg; Wireless HDMI, digital display products can be mounted anywhere in the room without needing to run data cabling from the TV to the content source, such as a DVR, Blu-ray or HD DVD player, or a live cable or satellite feed. Video data is encoded using the JPEG2000 video codec, the same codec used by movie theaters for &ldquo;Digital Cinema,&rdquo; providing a secure high quality HD experience. Pulse-LINK&rsquo;s Wireless HDMI solution is engineered to be equivalent in both content protection and visual experience to a wired HDMI connection.</p></blockquote>
<p>Interesting that the initial take-up of JPEG2000 in consumer electronics may come from the video arena rather that the still image photography arena.  (This announcement comes via a private communication with Ron Murray at LC.)</p>
<p>The second item is <a href="http://www.ams.org/notices/200802/tx080200226p.pdf" title="&#039;What is JPEG?&#039;">a paper in the February 2008 issue of Notices of AMS where David Austin explains how JPEG and JPEG2000 compress image data</a>.  It is a short (just over three pages) look at the compression algorithms from a mathematical point of view.  (This comes via <a href="http://mogadalai.wordpress.com/2008/01/02/how-does-jpeg-work/" title="&#039;How does JPEG work?&#039; in Entertaining Research">a posting in Entertaining Research</a>.)</p>
<p>Update 20080108T1213 : Add to this now <a href="http://jeffmatherphotography.com/dispatches/2008/01/the-jpeg-family-circus/" title="&#039;The JPEG Family Circus&#039; in Jeff Mather&#8217;s Dispatches">a posting by Jeff Mather that describes the various compression schemes and file formats that share the JPEG moniker</a>.  Do you think there is only one, or possibly two, "JPEG" standards.  Read Jeff's posting for an overview of everything that is out there.</p>
