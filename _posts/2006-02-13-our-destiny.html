    <strong>The Library Blogs I Read</strong>

    Here's my quick and dirty list of the library blogs I read on a regular basis. I just added Peter Murray's Disruptive Library Technology Jester, which has to be my all-time favorite blog title, though his tagline is bit odd--Peter's...

  content: "[...] While in UNC-CH for JCDL I&#8217;ve had occasion to rant with/at
    some people about the state of the integrated library system marketplace &mdash;
    including, of course, how we got into the spot we&#8217;re in and how we might
    get out of it (and those people were kind enough to engage in the rant). Along
    comes a series of posts from Casey Bisson and Nicole Engard ultimately pointing
    back to John Blyberg&#8217;s &#8220;ILS Customer Bill-of-Rights&#8221; that is
    singing the same tune. There still seems to be a desire for a solution from an
    existing vendor, and in fact that was part of counter-points brought up by some
    on the receiving end of the ILS-must-go rant. (Paraphrased: &#8216;No one can
    satisfy the need of a library like a library automation vendor&#8217; and &#8216;As
    libraries we&#8217;re not strong enough to take on the task of building the next
    ILS ourselves.&#8217;) Yet there does seem to be this mounting pressure to get
    control again over our data and how we present it to patrons. &#182; [...]"

  content: "Gosh, Jester, I feel like I'm late in coming to the party!\r\n\r\nCongrats
    on putting out some thought provoking commentary.  Allow me to correct a couple
    of points in your history (call it revisionist history if you will).  And, yes,
    we did the end user part last!  In fact, I would argue that we still continue
    in some cases to do that, but that's another story.  \r\n\r\nAll the programming
    talent did not leave libraries and go into business for themselves.  Certainly
    some did...although one could argue reasonably well that the transfer of talent
    was limited to a small number of cases that actually became commercially viable
    at that time.  In other cases, talent from outside of the library world brought
    resources to bear on the challenges inside of the library world.  \r\n\r\nIn looking
    back over a history, any history actually, it is too easy to spot themes or structures
    that may or may not have been at play during the given period.  In this case,
    I think that many individuals, both from within and without the library community
    were looking for ways to apply the computational power of semi-early modern computing
    to some very real data management and physical management issues troubling the
    typical library.  As is frequently the case, people at organizations with relatively
    more resources were up to bat first.  We have to remember that in that period
    computing remained a highly specialized and expensive endeavor.  \r\n\r\nYes,
    as Christensen, whom you quote elsewhere, notes, the 70's were the decade that
    included the introduction of the minicomputer.  An interesting aside, even by
    the late 70's and early 80's many minis were not all the \"mini\" nor were they
    inexpensive!  \r\n\r\nAs for the giving away of code, yes that happened in some
    cases, but what was given away was also highly particular to a specific library
    and came with no support or implementation guidance.  (Gee, is that any different
    today?  One wonders!) One could argue that this outcome is what led to the commercial
    viability of the typical library ILS vendor.  \r\n\r\nThere is, however, I believe,
    a deeper issue, call it the elephant in the living room that no one can discuss.
    \ Perhaps in that period of time it was necessary to develop, seek out, or purchase
    highly speciaized technology aimed solely at the library market...mainly because
    there wasn't a COTS option for software that would run on multiple platforms and
    be adapted to circumstances.  It is not productive to fault our fore fathers/mothers
    in libraryland for what happened in this regard.  BUT it laid a foundation of
    thinking that remains a huge burden today.  That is: that all library applications
    are specialized.  \r\n\r\nAt one time yes, but questionably so today or in the
    past decade or so.  \r\n\r\n<blockquote><i>He says only partially in jest:</i></blockquote>\r\n\r\nWhy
    can't acquistion orders be handled in <i>PeopleSoft</i>?\r\nWhy do we continue
    to track serials check-in when in many cases it is too costly and time-inefficient
    to claim them anyway?  Do we really need to check-in e-serials?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
    big challenge is not just that we have a large investment in legacy style technology
    and processes, but our thinking and values are also caught in this trap...which
    is exactly what Christensen describes in the commercial context with disruptive
    technologies.  \r\n\r\nIt would be foolish, however, to conclude that all we need
    to do is to drop the legacy thinking and our problems are resolved...or to spin-off
    neo-libraries with resources that are free from the past to soar to new info delivery
    heights while starving off the \"uncool\" other parts of library organizations.
    \ Interesting thought: that is exactly what many large libraries are doing with
    their digital library programs in the name of jump starting new programs.  And,
    you will note, that is not at all what Christensen suggests  in the business world.
    \ He does not say that sustaining technologies are bad or should be immediately
    dropped.  His is a model that is built entirely with an assumed understanding
    of markets.  \r\n\r\nLibraries and the people working in them, particularly academic
    ones, even many of the neo-Ranganathan types and edge thinkers, have not demonstrated
    a clear understanding of markets and being market driven.  Libraries have traditionally
    been ideal driven, e.g., just in case, collect and preserve the knowledge of humanity,
    teach users the proper way to conduct research, precision and recall, freedom
    of access, multiple points of view, intellectual freedom, etc.  Please note: I
    am NOT denegrating these values, just describing a tension that exists.  \r\n\r\nMarket
    thinking tends to be very matter-of-fact, and to a large degree, drive by numbers.
    \ Library service, on the other hand, tends not to be.  If anything our colleagues
    in public libraries have a thing or two to teach those of us in the academic world
    about markets.  \r\n\r\nSo, improvement is not just a matter of attracking creative
    programming talent \"back\" to libraries.  Many libraries already have that in
    relative abundance.  We have deeper organizational issues to resolve.  And those
    do not change over night."

  content: "Thanks for initiating a discussion a discussion on Christensen.    \r\nActually,
    what Christensen suggests is -if I remember that right- to do the new, potentially
    disruptive stuff, but outside the organization. Then maybe later when there is
    no real market for the old way, the spin-off structure can integrate the old one,
    while keeping alive both models. Well this is seen in market terms. To some extent,
    we can argue that even if a technology/or model is only useful to a handful of
    researchers, it may be very important to support it because it is the core of
    an institution's value. \r\nBut that also reminds me of a talk at a workshop several
    years ago on costs of digitization. A speaker stated that her library had to do
    the old job + the new digitization/digital services one, that costs more money
    and you have to prioritize. The tension between a traditional conception of the
    library and a new activity made her wonder whether that was really her job to
    do that (the user community can be different). She suggested that maybe she should
    just concentrate on her primary mission and leave the other job to another structure
    that would have a more appropriate mission, resources and organization. Well,
    the \"all digital\" structure model, like CDL or OhioLink (?) could have been
    a way of doing that. Except that I heard D. Greenstein a year ago stating that
    libraries and museums had to be in the business of resisting Google's competition
    and something like finding niche markets. I could not really find here that an
    \"all digital\" library model had any different position than a traditional one.
    The digital library programs have led to a modification in human resources -I
    heard a University stating 1 librarian for 3 CS for example. Additionally, new
    LIS students include a number of students with a CS background and sometimes have
    a pretty good CS training. All this should make it possible to significantly modify
    the potential contributions of the library community to less specialized types
    of applications???? \r\ntheoretically, \"all digital library organizations\" should
    have a different type of staff (like digital library programs) and potentially
    develop a different culture (less legacy issue here)?"

<p>What follows is pure conjecture; I did not live through the time in question, I can only speculate based on biased evidence and anecdotal hearsay.  This is a blog, after all, right?  Feedback is welcome.</p>

<p>This is the story of library automation as I understand it.  At one point, say the 1970s and early 1980s, libraries were at the forefront of information technology.  After all, we had an application, call it a specialized inventory control problem if you will, that was ripe for automation.  And our major research universities did just that -- built grand systems that tracked the circulation and location of our books, then automated the process of copy cataloging, then acquiring items and tracking serials, and finally the "OPAC."  (Is that really true? -- Did we do the end user part last?)  These libraries had in-house programming teams than built these systems, then (again: "I think") in the hacker tradition of the era gave away the code.</p>
<p>And that was okay for some, but for many there was the desire or demand for professional support.  So the automation design and programming teams left the research universities to form companies that sold and supported software for our specialized inventory control problem, draining talent from in-house library organizations.</p>

<p>Those organizations have never recovered.  Libraries are now reliant on vendors with legacy, specialized inventory control systems that themselves are struggling to reinvent what they are.</p>
<p>So here is the thesis:  <strong>We must regain control over our own automation destiny.</strong></p>
<p>The vendors, god love 'em, are too far from our users.  I believe they are aware of that; I know that I hit myself regularly with the "you- work- in- a- consortial- office- not- in- a- library" stick until it hurts just so that I never forget how distant I am.  (Distance, by the way, is not always a bad thing since it does give you a perspective of being a service organization serving a service organization.)  But don't forget -- the vendors, being commercial entities as well, move to a distinctly different rhythm and set of organizational values.  And right now, if you subscribe to <a href="/category/christensen/">Clayton Christensen</a>'s theory of disruptive innovation, they are chasing each other higher and higher up the sustainable innovation line and have surpassed the requirements of the vast majority of their users.</p>
<p>If you are an aspiring student of Christensen's work with a lot of energy (<span class="removed_link" title="http://www.theinnovationinsider.com/2006/01/are_librarians_and_educators_a.php">as I have been accused of having</span>, accurately so probably) then your next question is "What will be the disruptive technology?" followed closely by "Where is the elasticity in this supply chain?"</p>
<p>Ourselves.  After decades of rebuilding, there is a growing wealth of talent in our own libraries.  The distribution of this talent, however, is different from days of yore.  It is not concentrated in the research libraries, and likely never will be again.  It is in all of our organizations, in little bits here and there.  What will be the blueprint for working together?  The philosophies and tools of the open source community.  If "real world" individuals and small teams can come together to build great software -- Linux, Apache Httpd, Mozilla Firefox, Open Office -- what's to stop us from doing the same?</p>
<p>And you know what?  We get to start over.  We get to build on the knowledge of our specialized inventory control systems and maybe realize that they aren't all that different from generalized inventory control systems used in today's businesses.  So maybe we can take one and adapt it to our needs.  And maybe we can take a few pages from the electronic booksellers' handbook, along with a whole ocean of Onyx metadata, and change how our public interfaces operate.  (We have lots more to learn from booksellers too, but that is an essay for another time.)  And while we're at it, lets look at Service Oriented Architectures and Java Server Faces and Ruby on Rails and RSS and AJAX and all of those other "Web 2.0" technologies that are making systems more interactive and usable (when applied the right way).  Let's not strap then onto legacy applications -- let's design with them and their successors in mind.</p>
