  content: Fixed the typo -- thanks for pointing it out.  And I agree that most application
    developers don't care, but those that keep track of IP addresses -- such as those
    who use IP addresses as a way to limit access to content -- will need to update
    their code in preparation for the point in time when the underlying host operating
    system is using IPv6.  For instance, many content publishers do not rely on usernames/passwords
    to access their services; as a convenience to the reader they instead look at
    the IP address of the client to see if it is coming from a known subscriber range.  That
    code will break when an IPv6 connection comes in.  Much like Y2K, it is easier
    to plan for the change in the size of the address field (and corresponding program
    logic) now rather than have to do it in a panic later.

  content: Semantic Web is not just about findability of (meta)data, but also about
    their reuse across websites and platforms. Schema.org seems to address only the
    first aspect, but not the second. Am I wrong?

  content: I don't think reuse is as much of an issue as long as one can live with
    the expressiveness of the vocabulary.  There has already been work done to create
    <a href="http://schema.rdfs.org/" rel="nofollow">equivalent RDF-based vocabularies</a>
    for the schema.org entities, which should ease translation.  The problem as I
    see it, though, is that schema.org is a take-it-or-leave-it kind of thing.  There
    is an <a href="http://schema.org/docs/extension.html" rel="nofollow">extension
    mechanism</a> but it really only takes you so far when you are describing specialized
    entities.  (Perhaps Google/Microsoft/Yahoo! are intentionally limiting or controlling
    the scope of what they are interested in?)

<p>Two threads this week: the first is an <a href="#p2946-schema-org">announcement from the major search engine on a way they agree to discover machine-processable information in web pages</a>.  The search engines want this so they can do a better job understanding the information web pages, but it stomps on the linked data work that has been a hot topic in libraries recently.  The second is a red-letter day in the history of the internet as <a href="#p2946-ipv6">major services tried out a new way for machines to connect</a>.  The test was successful, and its success means a big hurdle has been crossed as the internet grows up.<br />

<h2 id="p2946-schema-org">Introducing schema.org: Search engines come together for a richer web </h2>
<blockquote><p>Many sites are generated from structured data, which is often stored in databases. When this data is formatted into HTML, it becomes very difficult to recover the original structured data. Many applications, especially search engines, can benefit greatly from direct access to this structured data. On-page markup enables search engines to understand the information on web pages and provide richer search results in order to make it easier for users to find relevant information on the web. Markup can also enable new tools and applications that make use of the structure.
<div style="text-align: right; width: 100%;"><cite>- <a href="http://schema.org/" title="schema.org homepage" rel="homepage">schema.org &ndash; Home</a></cite></div>
</blockquote>
<p>As the quote above suggests, much of the data on the web starts as structured information, but HTML by itself lacks the semantic hooks to easily bring meaning to that information.  Search engine robots and indexing algorithms have to try to infer the meaning of bits of information from surrounding context.  Sometimes they can get really good at it, and sometimes not.  So last week <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/06/introducing-schemaorg-search-engines.html" title="Introducing schema.org: Search engines come together for a richer web | Official Google Blog">Google</a>, <a href="http://www.bing.com/community/site_blogs/b/search/archive/2011/06/01/bing-google-and-yahoo-unite-to-build-the-web-of-objects.aspx" title="Bing Introducing Schema.org: Bing, Google and Yahoo Unite to Build the Web of Objects | Bing Community">Microsoft Bing</a>, and <a href="http://www.ysearchblog.com/2011/06/02/introducing-schema-org-a-collaboration-on-structured-data/" title="Introducing schema.org: A Collaboration on Structured Data">Yahoo!</a> announced a <a href="http://schema.org/" title="schema.org - Home">project</a> to promote machine-readable markup for structured data on web pages.  What does this mean? Take this example from this <a href="http://schema.org/Event" title="Event - schema.org">documentation page on how to describe an event</a>:</p>
{% highlight xml %}
<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Event">
  <a itemprop="url" href="nba-miami-philidelphia-game3.html">
  NBA Eastern Conference First Round Playoff Tickets:
  Miami Heat at Philadelphia 76ers - Game 3 (Home Game 1)
  </a>
  <time itemprop="startDate" datetime="2011-04-21T20:00">
    Thu, 04/21/11
    8:00 p.m.
  </time>
  <div itemprop="location" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Place">
    <a itemprop="url" href="wells-fargo-center.html">
    Wells Fargo Center
    </a>
    <div itemprop="address" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/PostalAddress">
      <span itemprop="addressLocality">Philadelphia</span>,
      <span itemprop="addressRegion">PA</span>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div itemprop="offers" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/AggregateOffer">
    Priced from: <span itemprop="lowPrice">$35</span>
    <span itemprop="offerCount">1,938</span> tickets left
  </div>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}
<p>There are a number of things going on here.  Line #1 marks the beginning of the description of an event, and that event will have a URL for more information (line 2), a start time (line 6), a location (lines 10 through 19) with an address (lines 14 through 19), and an item for sale -- in this case, a ticket (lines 20 through 24).  With this information, the search engines can more easily understand content on web pages to put them on a map or compare prices.</p>
<p>This, of course, intersects with what libraries have been doing for a long time -- describing things to make them easier for library patrons to find.  The creators behind 'schema.org' have thought about this as well because they have ways of describing <a href="http://schema.org/CreativeWork" title="CreativeWork - schema.org">creative works of various types</a> and the <a href="http://schema.org/Person" title="Person - schema.org">people associated with them</a>.  If you have wondered what the Semantic Web and Linked Data was about, this is <em>sort of</em> an example of what people have been trying to do to bring "more intelligence" to the data encoded on our web pages.</p>
<p>The 'schema.org' announcement, of course, hasn't been without controversy.  In going down the path that they did, Google and Bing and Yahoo appear to have dismissed much of the last decade of work to bring the <a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Semantic.html" title="Semantic Web roadmap">semantic web vision</a> to fruition.  (Primarily, using a standard called <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/" title="RDFa Primer">RDFa</a> to embed this information in HTML pages.)  <a href="http://weibel-lines.typepad.com/weibelines/2011/06/uncommon-cause.html" title="Uncommon Cause: Schema.org and the Semantic Web | Weibel Lines">Several</a> <a href="http://manu.sporny.org/2011/false-choice/" title="The False Choice of Schema.org | The Beautiful, Tormented Machine">people</a> have commented on the project, and an <a href="http://schema.rdfs.org/about.html" title="schema.rdfs.org - Home">effort was started to unify the 'schema.org' proposal with the semantic web work</a>.  It remains to be seen, though, how what the impacts of this work will be.</p>

<p>As <a href="/article/thursday-threads-2011w5/#p2525-ipv4-addresses">noted in a previous <i><acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester">DLTJ</acronym> Thursday Thread</i></a>, the internet is <a href="/article/ipv4-ipv6-transition/" title="IPv4 Address Space Disappearing, Here Comes IPv6 | Disruptive Library Technology Jester">running out of addresses for devices on the network</a>.  A decade and a half ago the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/" title="Internet Engineering Task Force">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> realized this and created a next-generation standard called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6" title="IPv6 | Wikipedia">Internet Protocol version 6</a>, or IPv6, that would solve this problem by dramatically increasing the number of possible addresses (340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 versus 4,294,967,296 with IPv4).  Unfortunately, for deep technical reasons, it is not easy to conversion from one to the other; they coexist peacefully but one needs a gateway to translate between the two.  And because IPv4 is embedded in lots of devices like printers and copiers and phones and set-top TV boxes and <a href="http://www.reviewsonline.com/articles/981056056.HTM" title="Reviews OnLine: Internet Washing Machine">washing machines</a> (any other strange internet-connected devices?), IPv4 is going to be with us for a while.</p>
<p>The test on June 8th was to have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110615182443/http://www.worldipv6day.org/participants/index.html" title="Internet Society - World IPv6 Day List of Participants">major internet services and networks</a> such as Google/YouTube, Facebook, and Yahoo! put their servers on IPv4 and IPv6 at the same name (e.g. "www.google.com").  For the most part, the test proved successful.  So the march to IPv6-for-all is on.  Are you a software developer?  And if so have you considered what changes you'll need to make to your code (as in "IP address-based access restrictions")?</p>
