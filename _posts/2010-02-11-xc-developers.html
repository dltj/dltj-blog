<p>Last month, the <a href="http://www.extensiblecatalog.org/" title="eXtensible Catalog Project homepage" rel="homepage">eXtensible Catalog</a> (XC) project posted <a href="https://listserv.nd.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind1001&L=CODE4LIB&T=0&F=&S=&P=77626" title="Job Opening: Java Deveopers - eXtensible Catalog Organization">job openings for  Java developers</a>.  These are short-term, grant-funded projects and, having been on the hiring side of that equation before myself, I know how difficult it is to get good people for a one- or two-year project.  The XC posting is different, though, in one important way:  it is possible to have XC buy out the time of a developer on staff for the time that the development is happening.<br />
<blockquote>Consideration will be made for qualified developers that are currently employed at another institution, but who may be available for loan to the XCO [eXtensible Catalog Organization].  The XCO would cover the salary and benefits of such individuals in the form of a direct payment to their host institution.  This is an excellent opportunity for a library to invest in open-source software for libraries as well as a way to temporarily offset staffing costs in a difficult economic environment.  Only staff that can be made available to XCO at 100% time (or close to that level) will be considered for this arrangement.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is also an excellent way for the project to begin the process of building an open source community that will sustain development effort beyond the grant-funded period.  What better way to build community that to infuse project work into people that will then return back to full-time work at their home institutions.</p>
<p>I'm curious to see how this plays out...</p>
