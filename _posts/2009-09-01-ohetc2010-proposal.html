<p>The theme of the <i><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20091209224533/http://www.etech.ohio.gov:80/conference/" title="Ohio Educational Technology Conference homepage">2010 Ohio Educational Technology Conference</a></i>, <b>P-20 Conversations: Shaping a Path for the 21st Century Student</b>, addresses the need to provide seamless technology integration throughout students' careers. Reflecting this year's theme, the sponsors of last year's Learning, Libraries and Technology conference &mdash; Ohio Learning Network (OLN), OhioLINK and OARnet &mdash; have joined with the Ohio Resource Center (ORC) and eTech Ohio, the technology service provider for primary and secondary education, to provide a premiere professional development event for all of us - teachers, faculty, librarians, instructional designers, administrators, students, and technicians.</p>
<p>The conference organizers are seeking interactive and engaging proposals for presentations, posters, and technology demonstrations.  Proposals for college and university audiences will be peer reviewed by a committee of higher education representatives.  In exchange for presenting a session or display, the presenter and co-presenter(s) will receive complimentary registration for the day of the presentation!</p>
<p>This year's conference features three types of proposals:</p>
<ul type="square">
<li><span class="removed_link" title="http://www.etech.ohio.gov/conference/register/proposals.dot#inroom">In the room</span>: 45-minute sessions of a variety of formats that are held concurrently in breakout rooms</li>
<li><span class="removed_link" title="http://www.etech.ohio.gov/conference/register/proposals.dot#onboard">On the board</span>: full-day poster displays located in the interactive Technology for Learning Center</li>
<li><span class="removed_link" title="http://www.etech.ohio.gov/conference/register/proposals.dot#outbox">Out of the box</span>: highly interactive, hands-on sessions that are held in the Technology for Learning Center</li>
</ul>
<p>All proposals must be submitted through the online proposal system hosted by eTech.  To submit a proposal, the presenter must <span class="removed_link" title="https://www.etech.ohio.gov/jcore/hallpass/CreateNewHallPassEnhanced.jsp">create an account</span> in eTech Ohio's online user account system, called "Hall Pass."  (When prompted for "Organization Category" select "Other" followed by "College/University")  With that account you can submit the proposal by following the "Begin a proposal" link at one of the three proposal types above. <strong>The deadline to submit a proposal is October 7, 2009.</strong>  Please note that the proposal deadline will not be extended.</p>
