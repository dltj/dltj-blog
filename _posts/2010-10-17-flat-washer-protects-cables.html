  content: What a cool idea. I bet it could be used to deter opportunistic theft by
    using a <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.bufocraft.net/pics/tie.JPG">plastic
    tie</span> looped through something on the backside of the computer.<p style="padding:0;margin:0;font-style:italic;"

  content: Good point, Ryan -- particularly since the plastic tie would be hidden
    behind the computer case.  That would make it just a small bit harder to simply
    unplug the cable and take the component.

    demonstration pictures.  Needless to say, the technique also works with USB cables.

  content: True, possible, but trying to do so would be fairly obvious to anyone walking
    by.  I think I'd put this in the same likelihood as someone cutting the cable
    to get to the component.

  content: <!--%kramer-ref-pre%-->[...] Can I use the integrated webcam that came
    with my PC/Mac laptop or desktop? We do not recommend using the integrated webcam
    that came with your laptop or desktop computer. &nbsp;Our tests of several different
    integrated cameras have shown mixed results with the video quality, including
    fuzziness, trailing images while moving, and lower frame rates. &nbsp;While some
    have in fact performed adequately enough for spoken and signed language interpretation,
    none of them has had the same quality as a mid-range external webcam rated at
    720p video streaming. &nbsp;We feel that the inconsistencies with these results
    across different computer manufacturers, makes and models are enough to push for
    external webcam use.   Can I use the webcam drivers that came with my computer?
    If you use an external webcam, we always recommend that you install the proper
    software drivers that came with your webcam. Using generic webcam drivers found
    on most computers could result in reduced video and audio quality, as the generic
    drivers have not been optimized for each webcam&#039;s hardware and firmware.
    &nbsp;You may also experience problems with Adobe Flash Player, such as the plug-in
    freezing or crashing, if you try to use a webcam without first installing proper
    drivers (see this article about Logitech Webcam Pro 9000 for an example).   If
    you use an integrated webcam, or if your external webcam came pre-installed with
    your computer, then the webcam drivers already on your computer are probably suitable
    for your webcam.   How do I prevent my webcam from being stolen? While this won&#039;t
    completely foil someone, a simple trick to deter theft is to use a flat metal
    washer with a 1/2" diameter hole along with a standard computer security cable
    and follow the procedure found in this article:&nbsp;http://dltj.org/article/flat-washer-protects-cables/

  content: Yes, exactly Keith.  A bike cable should make a good theft deterrent, and
    with a combination lock anyone on staff with the combination can replace components
    as needed.

You can use <a href="http://www.ddsecurity.com/product/50" title="Cord-Lok Keyboard-Mouse Protection">one</a> of <a href="http://www.tufnut.com/category.aspx?id=10" title="Low-Cost Mouse Lock &amp;amp; Keyboard Lock, Clip Lock &amp;amp; Cable Lock, PC Card Security">these</a> specially built products to lock down the cables, or you can use a 20&cent; flat washer from the hardware store to protect these components from minor mischief.<br />

The only thing that you need is a standard flat washer.  The size of the washer is key -- the hole in the middle needs to be big enough to pass the cable through twice but not so big that the end of the cable will pass through the hole in the flat washer.  A <a href="http://www.doitbest.com/Lock+washers-Hillman+Fastener-model-6435-doitbest-sku-710660.dib" title="http://www.doitbest.com/Lock+washers-Hillman+Fastener-model-6435-doitbest-sku-710660.dib">half-inch diameter hole</a> is about right.  Click on the images to see the larger versions.</p>
<h2 style="clear:both;">The Setup</h2>
<ol>
<li>Create a loop with the keyboard or mouse or USB cable.</li>
<li>Pass the loop through the flat washer.</li>
<li>Pass the security cable through the loop.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that this technique doesn't deter a determined despoiler because it can be defeated by dissecting the cable, but for will work in simplest case.  If someone really wants the keyboard or the mouse and is willing to cut the cord in half to remove the flat washer, they will get the component.  They will also have to patch the cable back together to make it useful, so odds are it isn't worth it.</p>
