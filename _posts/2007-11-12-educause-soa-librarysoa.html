<p><a href="http://scilib.typepad.com/science_library_pad/2007/11/soa-and-escienc.html" title="Science Library Pad: SOA and escience info via EDUCAUSE"> Richard Akerman's recent post highlighting SOA resources at Educause</a> reminded me about the <span class="removed_link" title="http://connect.educause.edu/term_view/Service-oriented+Architecture">aggregation point on Educause Connect for SOA resources</span>.  I'm assuming significant number of those interested in applying SOA to library systems are at an institution of higher education or in some related organization, so I'm adding the RSS feed for that aggregation to <span class="removed_link" title="http://librarysoa.dltj.org/">Planet LibrarySOA</span>.  This will undoubtedly result in a large spike of "new" postings to the planet aggregator, but should settle down after that.</p>
<p>If you are blogging about the application of SOA to libraries and want your postings to see a wider audience, <a href="http://dltj.org/librarysoa-request/">let me know</a> and I'll add you to the aggregator.</p>
