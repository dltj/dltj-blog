<p><a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/issues/issues/issue20" title="The Code4Lib Journal &amp;#8211; Issue 20">Issue #20 of the Code4Lib Journal</a> was just published, and I had the honor of being the coordinating editor for the issue.  Being on the editorial committee of the Journal has been a heck of an experience, and I think I've had just a taste of what journal editors and publishers must go through to produce quality content.</p>
<p>My <a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/8441" title="Editorial Introduction: It is Volunteers All the Way Down... | Code4Lib Journal Issue #20">editorial</a> focused on an issue that has banged around in my head for a while and has come up in multiple venues in recent years -- how do we grow as a community while remaining responsive to the community and true to its roots.  I suggest that there is a merit-based way to approach this, and I lay out my thoughts in that article.</p>
<p>In addition, the issue has seven great contributions from the community.  The first set of articles show ways to manipulate metadata records. &nbsp;In <a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/8419" title="Workflow Tools for Digital Curation | Code4Lib Journal Issue #20">Workflow Tools for Digital Curation</a> Andrew James Weidner and Daniel Gelaw Alemneh describe how they use AutoHotkey and Selenium IDE at the University of North Texas to automate various aspects of manipulating digital objects. &nbsp;Heidi Frank show how to process MARC records from Archivists Toolkit in <a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/8336" title="Augmenting the Cataloger&#8217;s Bag of Tricks : Using MarcEdit, Python, and PyMARC for Batch-Processing MARC Records Generated From the Archivists&#8217; Toolkit | Code4Lib Journal Issue #20">Augmenting the Cataloger&rsquo;s Bag of Tricks</a>; the techniques &ndash; using MarcEdit, Python, and PyMARC &ndash; are transferrable to other sources of records as well. &nbsp;In <a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/8375" title="Keeping up with Ebooks: Automated Normalization and Access Checking with Normac | Code4Lib Journal Issue #20">Keeping up with Ebooks</a> Kathryn Lybarger introduces a tool for updating batches of vendor-supplied records through a set of normalization routines.</p>
<p>Jason Clark show how Montana State University is using YouTube as a digital video platform in <a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/7847" title="Developing a Digital Video Library with the YouTube Data API | Code4Lib Journal Issue #20">Developing a Digital Video Library with the YouTube Data API</a>. Getting users what they want without extraneous hits is always a challenge, and in <a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/7787" title="Better Search Through Query Expansion Using Controlled Vocabularies and Apache Solr | Code4Lib Journal Issue #20">Better Search Through Query Expansion Using Controlled Vocabularies and Apache Solr</a> demonstrates how to configure SOLR to make the best use of a hierarchical controlled vocabulary. &nbsp;In <a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/8327" title="Breaking Up With CONTENTdm: Why and How One Institution Took the Leap to Open Source | Code4Lib Journal Issue #20">Breaking Up With CONTENTdm</a> Heather Gilbert and Tyler Mobley lead us through the migration of a repository to Fedora Commons using Drupal, Blacklight and Rutgers&rsquo; OpenWMS software. &nbsp;And for the hardware geeks, Tim Ribaric and Jonathan Younker describe how to build a simple desk counter tied to a Google Spreadsheet in <a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/8200" title="Arduino-enabled Patron Interaction Counting | Code4Lib Journal Issue #20">Arduino-enabled Patron Interaction Counting</a>.</p>
