<p>This blog will be present first-time users with a warning page on January 18, 2012 -- the day that many internet sites are using to protest the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) -- and January 23rd, 2012 -- <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/articles/view/2458-PIPA-first-on-Senate-agenda-on-Jan-24th-2012" title="PIPA first on Senate agenda on Jan. 24th, 2012 - Blog - OpenCongress">the day before the U.S. Senate may vote on the PROTECT-IP act</a>.  <i><acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester">DLTJ</acronym></i> is proud to join <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/01/17/sopa-companies-dark-list/" title="These Websites Are Going Dark to Protest SOPA">many other sites</a> in this demonstration of solidarity for an open, transparent internet.</p>
<p>Thought you heard that SOPA was dead?  Or was modified to be acceptable?  Or that PIPA is on the ropes?  As of January 17th, these statements aren't true:</p>
<ul>
<li>Representative Lamar Smith, House Judiciary Chair and sponsor of SOPA, <span class="removed_link" title="http://judiciary.house.gov/news/01172012.html">issued a statement that said committee discussion of SOPA will continue in February</span>.</li>
<li>Although proponents have said they will remove the DNS redirection provisions, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/01/how-pipa-and-sopa-violate-white-house-principles-supporting-free-speech">there are still dangerous and unprecedented parts of the bills</a>.</li>
<li>There are still <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/wiki/Protect_IP_Act_Senate_whip_count" title="Protect IP Act Senate whip count - OpenCongress Wiki">more Senators in favor of PIPA (39) than not (16)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This legislation is bad for the health of the internet, bad for companies -- those that exist now and those that would otherwise come -- that make their living on the internet, and bad for the standing of the United States in the global community supporting freedom of speech and due process principles.</p>
<p>Looking for something to do to make your opinions known?  Try one more more of these:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/contact_congress_letters/new?bill=112-s968" title="http://www.opencongress.org/contact_congress_letters/new?bill=112-s968">Contact Congress</a> form on the OpenCongress site to send an e-mail to your Senators or use the OpenCongress <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/people/zipcodelookup" title="Find Your Senators and Representatives - OpenCongress">Find Your Senators and Representatives</a> to look up their phone numbers.  The Wikipedia SOPA Initiative page has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SOPA_initiative/Proposed_Messages#Draft_Things_to_say_to_elected_Representatives" title="Wikipedia:SOPA initiative/Proposed Messages - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">some good phrasing of things to say</a> based on your concerns.  If outside the United States, use the <span class="removed_link" title="http://americancensorship.org/modal/state-dept-petition/index.html">Petition the U.S. State Department form</span> on americancensorship.org.</li>
<li>Look into the <a href="http://rootstrikers.org/" title="Rootstrikers">#Rootstrikers movement</a>.  A big part of the disconnect and dysfunctional nature of public office holders is the role that campaign contributions play -- or, at best, have the appearance of influence -- in the public policy decision making.  This certainly <a href="http://dltj.org/article/campaign-contributions-and-judiciary-committee-votes-on-sopa/" title="Campaign Contributions and Judiciary Committee Votes on SOPA (and a Plug for Rootstrikers) | Disruptive Library Technology Jester">seems to be true for the current SOPA debate</a>.</li>
<li>Watch the <a href="http://www.informationdiet.com/blog/read/better-activism-day-january-18" title="Information Diet | Learn to Be a Better Activist During the SOPA Blackouts">Learn to Be a Better Activist</a> webcast on January 18th (or the recording after that day).  It is a full day of talks from people who know something about making voices heard in Congress.</li>

<li>Read the Electronic Frontier Foundation's list of <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/12/fight-blacklist-toolkit-anti-sopa-activists">about a dozen other things</a> you could do.</li>
