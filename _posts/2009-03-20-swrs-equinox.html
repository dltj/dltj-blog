    libraries using Innovative be participating too?

  content: What does it mean for OhioLINK?  Perhaps something; perhaps nothing.  In
    the short term it is probably more applicable to the public libraries that are
    in <a href="http://ohpir.westervillelibrary.org/" rel="nofollow">Search Ohio</a>
    now and the libraries that want to join in a seamless resource sharing system.  In
    the longer term, FulfILLment could be considered as one of the strategic building
    blocks of the Catalog Architecture group.  Having the state library and the other
    members of the collaborative invest in this tool and have it available in open
    source does inspire different ways of thinking about how we could re-engineer
    our systems, though.

    database of bibliographic data.  (The RFP itself was somewhat agnostic on the
    question -- it offered respondents the option of bidding a union database or a
    broadcast search.)"

<p>This is an announcement posted by the State Library of Ohio regarding the selection of FulfILLment from Equinox for a statewide resource sharing system.</p>
<blockquote><p>OPEN SOURCE STATEWIDE RESOURCE SHARING SYSTEM PROPOSAL FROM EQUINOX HAS BEEN ACCEPTED.</p>
<p>The State Library of Ohio is pleased to announce Equinox Software Inc. has been selected to develop a new open source resource sharing solution called Equinox FulfILLment. The goal of the project is to develop a seamless resource sharing application under an open source licensing framework in an environment of disparate integrated library systems (ILSs).</p>
<p>An Open Source Statewide Resource Sharing Request for Proposal (RFP) was issued on December 15, 2008.  The RFP process and acceptance of the Equinox proposal are the result of a collaborative effort, initiated by the State Library of Ohio, of multiple State Libraries and regional library network providers.  This resource sharing system will first be deployed in Ohio, but will also be deployed individually by the members of the Collaborative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a very exciting and promising collaborative effort,&rdquo; said State Librarian of Ohio Jo Budler.  &ldquo;We have a common vision of how resource sharing should work and how this would benefit the residents of each of our states.  But this is the first time that I recall so many state libraries and statewide networks have been successful in combining resources toward such a shared vision and goal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Members of the Collaborative include:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>State Library of Ohio</li>
<li>OHIONET (fiscal agent)</li>
<li>WiLS &ndash; Wisconsin Library Service</li>
<li>State Library of Iowa</li>
<li>State Library of Illinois</li>
<li>State Library of Indiana</li>
<li>State Library of Missouri</li>
<li>State Library of South Carolina</li>
</ul>
<p>Information about the RFP process can be found at <a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20090320000000/http://www.library.ohio.gov/swrs/rfp/" title="Statewide Resource Sharing Request for Purchase | State Library of Ohio">http://www.library.ohio.gov/swrs/rfp</a> and future updates of the Equinox FulfILLment development process will be posted to our Statewide Resource Sharing homepage at <a href="http://www.library.ohio.gov/swrs" title="Statewide Resource Sharing Home | State Library of Ohio">http://www.library.ohio.gov/swrs</a>.</p></blockquote>
