  content: "When Amazon.com states works that have only just been published with new
    ISBNs are 'out of print' because publishers and authors either can't (because
    foreign company with no US bank account) or won't do a deal with them (because
    Amazon demand 55% of the list price/rrp, which only encourages publishers to raise
    the list price artificially, working against the consumer interest), one wonders
    how long it would be before simply stating 'out of print' - when it is no such
    thing - would itself be enough to trigger a rights grab by Google, or some other
    online giant. The abuse of power is staggeringly virulent even among the most
    apparently forward-thinking and modern of companies. Not only should Google not
    be allowed to do this, for even suggesting such a wholesale rights-theft they
    should be shut down. They have gone beyond irresponsible and planted their giant
    jack-boots squarely in the scary zone of fascist dictatorships. That&rsquo;s really
    not overstating the case. This is a hideous, hideous, hideous idea that could
    only spring from the imagination of the truly soulless. Go away Google. Your pretence
    as a force for good has now been well and truly exposed as the anti-human tool
    it really is. You care nothing for art, or talent, or human endeavour, or hopes
    and dreams. You care nothing for toil and sweat and diligence and individuality
    and imagination. Someone creates something? So what, let's steal it and sell it.
    We get the picture. Screw them; screw anyone naive enough to think their individual
    effort should be respected in any way. There&rsquo;s a book out called &lsquo;The
    Attempted Murder of God: Hidden Science You Really Need To Know&rsquo; in which
    it touches on the rampant greed and callous disregard big business has shown for
    the ordinary folk of the world and one would never before this have imagined that
    anyone could reasonably name Google in such bad company. That, sadly, has now
    changed. We all believed in Google. We all believed it was something special.
    We viewed the way it treated its employees and championed disaster-relief and
    recognized noble thinkers and creators from the past on its home page.  It was
    a business, sure it was, and it was about profits, of course it was, but it seemed
    itself to want to walk that same noble path through history as those it recognized
    on its site. What a difference a day makes. Google is now history. \r\n\r\n  Let&rsquo;s
    hope the next online giant doesn&rsquo;t think they can be so cavalier with people&rsquo;s
    talent. \r\n\r\n  The only way out of this for Google &ndash; and I hope they
    take it &ndash; is to offer a massive apology for the unconscionable cheek and
    vow never to go near the topic again. Anything less and the damage to their reputation
    remains and anyone who continues to use Google to search online before they do
    so is complicit in this same ignoble enterprise. McG Productions Ltd for one is
    now moving to Microsoft&rsquo;s Live Search. The vote with the feet is the strongest
    online protest of all.\r\n\r\nMcG Productions Ltd\r\nPublisher\r\nhttp://www.mcgproductionsltd.com"

<p>Late last month, the University of Pittsburgh <a href="http://www.upress.pitt.edu/" title="University of Pittsburgh Press" rel="homepage">Press</a> and <a href="http://www.library.pitt.edu/" title="University Library System at University of Pittsburgh" rel="homepage">Library System</a> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100626103825/http://www.upress.pitt.edu/htmlSourceFiles/pressReleases/PittPressDigitalPR.pdf" title="500 Pitt Press Titles Available Again Online and In Print press release">announced</a> a joint effort to revive 500 titles with <a href="http://digital.library.pitt.edu/p/pittpress/" title="University of Pittsburgh Press Digital Editions">online</a> and print-on demand access.  I originally found this via a <a href="http://thecite.blogspot.com/2009/05/university-of-pittsburgh-press-to-make.html" title="The CITE: University of Pittsburgh Press to make 500 out-of-print titles available">post on the Course materials, Innovation, and Technology in Education (CITE)</a> blog.  Since we have been ramping up discussions here in Ohio about ways OhioLINK can be an aggregation point for efforts at the four university press services in Ohio, I was interested to read about this and learn more.<br />

<h2>Conversation with Rush Miller</h2>
<p>Earlier today, I had a conversation with Rush Miller, library director at the University of Pittsburgh, about the joint effort between the university press and the university library system.  Cynthia Miller (press director) and Rush arrived at approximately the same time 15 years ago at the University of Pittsburgh.  Over the course of that time, the two have shared many discussions about open access content.  A few years ago, they established a model for working together:  the press would clear the rights for books (the press generally had the rights to publish in paper, but not digital) while the libraries would digitize the books, mount them on library servers, and do the graphic design work for the online site.  With this model, they <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.library.pitt.edu/uls/news/pittpress.html">mounted 15 titles from the press' Latin American series</span>.  The libraries also supplied the <a href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/cdc.html" title="The Chicago Digital Distribution Center" rel="homepage">Chicago Digital Distribution Center</a> (CDDC) with the digital scans for the <a href="http://www.bibliovault.org/BV.index.epl" title="BiblioVault" rel="homepage">Bibliovault</a> print-on-demand service.  The library has seven full-time people in the digital services department, plus support from systems analysis and developers from elsewhere in the library.</p>
<p>They had been closely studying the usage and sales data with the trial content and had found that online access didn't necessarily cannibalize print sales.  In fact, one title sold about 100 copies last year while having near zero sales the previous few years.  (Adoption for a course is the suspected reason, and the item was probably found because the digital edition was online).  Books that have been out of print for 20 years are now getting use as soon as the digital editions are available.</p>
<p>With the initial success, the libraries and press moved forward with digitizing and mounting the 500-title backfile represented by this announcement.  This was a significant effort on the part of the press to clear the rights for all of these titles -- about a year's worth of work.  The partners are already looking forward to another round of titles to be digitized and mounted online.</p>
<p>From a library director's perspective, Rush appreciates the backing of the university press in the library's digital initiatives.  The support of the press gives more credibility to the digital initiatives and encourages faculty to participate.  The joint effort also closely aligns with the campus' desire to promote open access publishing.  Their goal is to establish a practice where titles in the pipeline now are put up for open access online after a one or two year window in print.</p>
<p>The library is using the DLXS software from the University of Michigan.  They are probably the largest user of the <a href="http://www.dlxs.org/" title="Digital Library eXtension Service" rel="homepage">DLXS software</a>, to include the University of Michigan.  They are looking at migrating the content to Fedora repository in the next year or so.  (They are also looking to migrate their EPrints-based ejournal service to Fedora as well.)</p>
<p>They are examining all options for scaling up print-on-demand.  (They had previously used Brookhaven Press in Wisconsin for a print-on-demand project of history of Pittsburgh monographs, but found the $50/item price point too high.)  They have not yet explored digital delivery to e-book readers (such as the Kindle or Sony Book Reader).  The kinds of materials the press produces does not lend themselves to the kinds of digital supplements (such as data sets, image collections, etc).</p>
<p>This library/press collaboration was built over several years even before the digital editions effort.  The press routinely donated complete runs of titles to the libraries to be used in exchange programs with foreign libraries to acquire new titles.</p>
<p>The move to digital editions with the press is part of a long-standing goal at the library to move to the digital version of content.  In the past year, for instance, the University of Pittsburgh purchased access to over 300,000 electronic books, and this continues a progression of physical to digital formats over the past few years.  In the case of the press' digital editions, the content can be spidered and harvested by search engines.  The descriptive metadata is also harvested and combined with the card catalog data and other content in the library's AquaBrowser discovery layer.</p>
