  content: "Sent to OCLC review board\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like to reiterate what I
    said at the ALA Midwinter meeting. I really appreciate the articulate comments
    made by the speakers. What you really end up dealing with are the messy metadata
    pieces that Peter Murray from OhioLink described. Furthermore it makes no sense
    to me that for every little project like the one described by the person from
    Newberry Library, where they were considering working with a commercial vendor
    to digitize their materials, should require that every library come and bow down
    to OCLC to have them allow the library to use their records in the project. That
    really does not scale as a process. You should use the type of free or shared
    use license that was suggested.\r\n\r\nI also dispute Karen Calhoun&rsquo;s explanation
    that only 2 % of a library&rsquo;s records are original cataloging so that&rsquo;s
    all they ever paid for. Excuse me. Libraries paid OCLC first time use fees that
    used to be $1.50 apiece. I believe we paid more than that for a 1.3 million recon
    project we did with OCLC. So we have literally paid OCLC millions of dollars.
    I would suggest that the purchasing and legal departments of universities would
    not allow them to sign up for OCLC under the terms of the proposed policy. So,
    OCLC is saying, pay us millions of dollars but you can only use those records
    if we say you can. I just don&rsquo;t think institutions would agree. Not for
    these MARC records where the bulk of them could be had from LC for free or for
    a minimal subscription price.\r\n\r\nOCLC is not advancing the interests of its
    members by trying to exert control over the use of MARC records. As I commented
    at the meeting, it is solidifying into a lump of rock in the stream and I think
    there should be a concern that the world will flow past and that will be the end
    of its usefulness. OCLC needs to have a different business plan instead of just
    depending on cataloging as the cash cow and then using such a lame policy to try
    to prop it up. You should put some kind of free use license on the records and
    charge for cataloging, ILL and other services like timely inclusion in Worldcat.org.
    Don&rsquo;t try to rent out the records, or worse prevent their use.\r\n\r\nI
    remember having to argue with developers at OCLC when I first started working
    there after being in a network. They were afraid to let libraries download MARC
    records into their local systems and tried to resist allowing that to happen (remember
    that&rsquo;s how Innovative Interfaces got started? By screen scraping to do that).
    Imagine what would have happened if OCLC had maintained that stance and refused
    to let people download to their ILS&rsquo;s . They would have gone elsewhere.
    The genie is out of the bottle. OCLC has not magic word to get it back. They need
    to move on to innovations, not protect records they never produced in the first
    place. They should find a way to help LC to continue to produce the many, many
    records we depend on getting from them. They are the ones who do the bulk of the
    work."

  content: Thank you, Frances.  I followed the link back to your blog and noted that
    you had posted a <a href="http://bdfar.wordpress.com/2009/02/02/oclc-hullaballou-ala-midwinter-2009-monday/"
    rel="nofollow">fairly comprehensive summary</a> of the the presentations at midwinter
    and the questions/answers from the floor after the presentations.  Folks will
    probably also be interested in reading that.

<p>OCLC <a href="http://www.oclc.org/us/en/news/releases/200910.htm" title="Review Board Named">announced</a> late yesterday the members of the review board.  In addition, they announced the establishment of an e-mail address for communicating with the review board (<a href="mailto:reviewboard@oclc.org">reviewboard@oclc.org</a>).</p>
<blockquote><p>Members of the Review Board of Shared Data Creation and Stewardship are:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Christopher Cole (FEDLINK): Associate Director for Technical Services, National Agricultural Library</li>
<li>Poul Erlandsen (EMEA): Head, Document Access Services and Collection Management, Danish University of Education, National Library of Education</li>
<li>Pat French (OCLC Western): Manager, Collection and Technical Services, Multnomah County Library</li>
<li>Clifford A. Lynch: Executive Director, Coalition for Networked Information (CNI)</li>
<li>Brian E. C. Schottlaender (OCLC Western): The Audrey Geisel University Librarian, UC San Diego Libraries</li>
<li>Ted Schwitzner (ILLINET): Head, Bibliographic Services Division, Illinois State University, Milner Library</li>
<li>Roberta Shaffer (FLICC/FEDLINK/LC): Executive Director, Federal Library and Information Center Committee, Library of Congress</li>
<li>Lamar Veatch (COSLA/SOLINET): State Librarian, Georgia Public Library Service&mdash;University System of Georgia</li>
<li>Elsie Weatherington (SOLINET): Dean, University Library, Virginia State University</li>
<li>Jennifer Younger (INCOLSA): Edward H. Arnold Director of Hesburgh Libraries, University of Notre Dame</li>
</ul>
<p>Another member from a European national library is expected to be appointed to the Review Board.</p></blockquote>
<p>I've already <a href="http://dltj.org/article/worldcat-discussion/">reiterated my call</a> for more conversation with the members of the review board, rather than a one-way feed of "reports, letters and comments including blog and listserv messages."  This evening I sent this message to <a href="mailto:reviewboard@oclc.org">reviewboard@oclc.org</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Members of the Review Board:</p>
<p>I respectfully request that the review board establish a mechanism to promote dialog among those interested in the guidelines and policies surrounding member-contributed creation and enhancements to WorldCat records. &nbsp;This is desirable, in part, to promote understanding by the members of the cooperative and the community; it is likely the outcome will be more accepted&nbsp;if the source documents from which the review board makes its determinations are commonly available. &nbsp;It is also useful for the community to share a forum to debate the issues in a manner that effectively consolidates the points of discussion for the review board; as it stands, discussion is duplicated and scattered across the internet.</p>
<p>Thank you for considering this request.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Peter Murray, speaking for himself, not for his employer</p></blockquote>
