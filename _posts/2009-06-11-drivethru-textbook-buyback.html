  content: Thanks, bookguy.  Perhaps this is something new to the midwest.  Or perhaps
    just to central Ohio.  (The manager of the operation did mention the now two-year-old
    setup in northeast Ohio.)

  content: Odd comment.  You cannot have a book market without a used book market.  To
    say that new books would cost less if there were no used books is one of those
    impossible scenarios that does not exist in the real world.  The only way it could
    exist is if all colleges bought new books for all of their students--and let the
    students keep the books.   What school has budget for that?

    you don't have the wrong way around:  we can't have a used book market without
    a (first sale) book market.  This is the copyright \"<a href=\"http://www.aallnet.org/Documents/Government-Relations/Copyright-2/FirstSaleDoctrine.html\"

    material you legally buy.\r\n\r\nTo say that new books would cost less if more
    of them were sold is a matter of economics.  Textbook (and most other physical
    goods) cost some large, fixed amount to produce the first copy, and then much
    lesser amounts to produce subsequent copies.  A publisher's ability to sell more
    subsequent copies spreads the fixed costs of the first copy over more units, lowering
    the per-unit costs of all copies.<p style=\"padding:0;margin:0;font-style:italic;\">The

  content: "You miss the point, of course you can't have a used market without an
    original manufacturer and I'm very familiar with the first sale doctrine, that's
    how I've made my living for 19 years.  \r\n\r\nI'm saying that unless the university
    buys all new books and gives them to students, that it is impossible not to have
    a used book market.  If a bookstore did not sell used, then students would start
    co-ops(and properly manage them), greek organizations would get serious about
    their text libraries, and of course you have the internet.  \r\n\r\nTherefore,
    to say that used books drive up the cost of new books is merely academic and distracting
    to the real conversion of finding methods for lowering textbook costs."

<p>I continue to be astonished by how efficient the used textbook market has become.  This week, at the end of the spring quarter at Ohio State University, a <em>drive-thru</em> textbook buy-back service popped up on the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=868+W+Lane+Ave,+Columbus,+OH&amp;sll=40.006547,-83.033724&amp;sspn=0.010897,0.014699&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=40.006547,-83.033724&amp;spn=0.010897,0.014699&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=40.006563,-83.03384&amp;panoid=hnFmVp1Ot1YdHsMpJhJbwA&amp;cbp=12,9.94,,0,5" title="Google Street View of 868 W Lane Ave, Columbus, OH">site of a long-closed gas station</a>.  It is a tent on a parking lot that truly does allow someone to drive through to drop off books (see the third image down).  The operation is run by <a href="http://budgetext.com/svc.coll.buyback.htm" "Budgetext Buyback Program" title="http://budgetext.com/svc.coll.buyback.htm">Budgetext</a>, a national textbook wholesaler from Fayetteville, AR.  I spoke with company representative Jerry Mohr about the service.<br />

<p>Budgetext is partnered with <a href="http://www.sbx-osu.com/" title="Student Book Exchange home page" rel="homepage">Student Book Exchange</a> (SBX) to bring this first-in-Columbus service to Ohio State.  Budgetext services the textbook wholesaling needs of SBX.  Since Budgetex has the list of textbooks through SBX that are needed for the next school term, it can more intelligently buy back the books that will be needed.  Jerry said that most of the books bought back through the drive thru service will stay in the area, with the remainder wholesaled through their national network.</p>
<p>It is hard to beat the convenience.  One literally drives up, hands the books over, and gets the cash back (or the book back if it is not needed by Budgetext).  On a day like today in Columbus -- with the downpour this morning and this afternoon -- that process certainly seems to beat lugging the books to a desk inside a bookstore.  </p>
<p>Although this is the first drive-through in central Ohio, it is not the first such setup in the state.  A drive-through program was set up at Owens Community College in northwest Ohio two years ago.  Jerry told me that in its first 4 1/2 days of operation, 500 cars came through.  The following term 1,500 cars came through.  All kinds of people come through -- parents with kids, handicapped individuals, even multiple students in one car.  Jerry said that one car last year had three students: one each from Owens Community College, the University of Toledo, and Bowling Green State University.  It is still too early to tell how well the service will do in this location.</p>
<p>The impact of these improved efficiencies in the used textbook market makes the <a href="/article/complex-world-of-the-textbook/">textbook ecosystem</a> even more complicated.  It is capitalism at its finest, but I'm not sure this present trajectory is sustainable.</p>
