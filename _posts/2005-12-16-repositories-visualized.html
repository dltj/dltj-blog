The <a href="http://www.hull.ac.uk/esig/repomman/ " title="RepoMMan home page">RepoMman project</a>at the University of Hull, UK, is looking into the area<br />
of workflow as related to an institutional repository.  Hull sees a digital<br />
repository as being a tool for its users, assisting them to develop a 'piece<br />
of work' (a generic term intended to cover almost anything) from inception<br />
to final form - supporting such things as development, collaboration and<br />
versioning along the way.  In other words, we see a repository as much more<br />
than a container only for 'finished' digital objects.  We are playing with<br />
the acronym 'AMP' (access, management, preservation) to describe some of the<br />
related functionality.
</p></blockquote>
<p>You and I are on the same page, Richard (it helps, of course, that we've<br />
talked before on this topic) -- our Ohio repository is not only for<br />
works that are "done" but also for works-in-progress.  Coming from the<br />
librarian perspective (it is hard to avoid since I work for a consortium<br />
of higher education libraries), I think of it as stewardship of<br />
knowledge as it is being created (to contrast it with the traditional<br />
role of librarianship -- stewardship of knowledge that is published, or<br />
"done").</p>
<p>The piece that I think is missing from your acronym, though, is the<br />
notion of storage.  In a marketing sense, we've been trying to think<br />
through what the 15-second description of our project is, and at this<br />
point we're working with:</p>
<p>  The Ohio Digital Resource Commons will store, preserve, enable<br />
  discovery of and promote collaboration with the educational<br />
  and research materials of participating institutions.</p>
<p>The words still aren't quite right, but the concepts are all there:<br />
storage, preservation, discovery, and collaboration.  It doesn't have a<br />
nice acronym like "AMP", either...</p>

In an effort to help with some visualisation, I've developed the attached<br />
diagram.  Do others find this at all useful?  Clearly, different<br />
institutions might have different user categories down the left; indeed, it<br />
might be useful to produce sub-diagrams with each of the lower categories of<br />
user broken down into individual job descriptions?
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a great diagram -- and it gets to the heart of many of the<br />
concepts I've been trying to get across to our own community.  The only<br />
issue I would bring up, and perhaps this is strictly a North American<br />
thing, is that the term "Institutional Repository" has become too<br />
synonymous with "dSpace" and so is really lost as a generic term-of-art.<br />
 I prefer to drop the term "institutional" (after all, it clashes<br />
somewhat with the Individual-Users/Private-Space concept) and use the<br />
phrase "Content Repository".</p>

<p>Attached is a different perspective on this -- the repository as the<br />
fundamental digital object layer upon which many of our existing<br />
services rest.  It attempts to convey the concept of an object<br />
repository as a generic tool and the services on top of them as<br />
specialized ingestion, presentation, and business rules layers.  You can<br />
also see this graphic in the context of a presentation:</p>
