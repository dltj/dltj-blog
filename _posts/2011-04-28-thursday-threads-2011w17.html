  content: "Re cloud. Not having as much control SEEMs like a downside when it happens
    to you, because there's nothing you can do and you feel like you should be doing
    something!\r\n\r\nBut realistically I'm not sure it matters. We DO have downtime
    to servers we keep locally. When our servers do go down, depending on what it
    was and when, it can take us varying time to get it back it up. \r\n\r\nWe don't
    have any AWS or commodity cloud stuff here, but I bet our overall hardware uptime
    is compatible or less than the last 3 years of AWS -- in which that 2-4 day period
    was just about the ONLY downtime. \r\n\r\nThen again, if you put a lot of extra
    effort into architecting backup, recovery, and redundancy with your AWS servers
    (including being able to bring your stuff up on an alternate cloud provider in
    a pinch?), you probably could have had incredibly short or non-existent downtime
    with the latest AWS downtime. Putting that amount of planning and testing (no
    backup or recovery plan is worth anything unless you test it) into it is going
    to increase the time/cost -- just like doing the same thing with in-house servers,
    and staffing your in-house server admin and maintenance sufficiently to minimize
    downtime would. \r\n\r\nIn the end, it's all about how much money (staff positions
    filled by clever/competent people+staff time+hardware+contracts) you want to put
    into it to maximize your uptime.  And which choice (AWS or in-house or something
    else) is going to be the biggest bang for your buck. But there's no magic bullet,
    including AWS, if you want to maximize your uptime you've got to know what you're
    doing and spend time/money on it."

    Very good points, Jonathan.  As the videos from later in the blog post demonstrate, running an efficient and effective data center is becoming a specialized and a commodity activity.  Based on my own experience running this blog on Amazon Web Services, I'm becoming more convinced that when taken as a whole -- especially the cost of amortizing hardware replacement and the personnel cost in physical management of the hardware -- it makes sense economically and service-wise to outsource the hardware layer.

    I don't think the same can be said at the operating system level yet -- it still makes sense to have sysadmins on staff to maintain the operating system -- but I wonder if someday it will be true that it makes sense to outsource the operating system management aspects as well and only hold onto the database and application layer functions.

    everything clearly. I enjoyed the article very much.  I also have read a article
    about this topic here "http://www.techyv.com/article/cloud-computing-vs-data-center-explained"  which
    is very helpful also.

<p>This week's <i><acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester">DLTJ</acronym> Thursday Threads</i> is about data centers -- those dark rooms with all of the blinking lights of computers doing our bidding.  Data centers hit the mainstream news this week with the <a href="#p2831-ec2-outage">outage at one of Amazon's cloud computing clusters</a>.  And since computers and their associated peripherals consume a lot of energy, researchers are proposing to <a href="#p2831-renewable">run data centers on renewable energy</a>.  And finally Facebook and Google release separate videos that give <a href="#p2831-running-datacenters">glimpses into how large data centers are run</a>.</p>

<h2 id="p2831-ec2-outage">Amazon EC2 Outage Hobbles Websites</h2>
<blockquote><p>Amazon Web Services' Elastic Compute Cloud, which offers computation as a service to thousands of businesses, and its Relational Database Service, began experiencing errors shortly before 2 a.m. PDT on Thursday at Amazon's US-EAST data center in Virginia and the service interruption has been ongoing for more than nine hours now.</p>
<p>The technical problems have slowed or disabled access to the websites of customers utilizing AWS US-East resources, including Engine Yard, Foursquare, Hootsuite, Heroku, Quora, and Reddit, to name a few.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Failures of Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud service -- think of it as renting virtual computer servers somewhere out there on the internet -- last week caused major internet sites to shut down.  As of this writing, the root cause analysis hasn't been published, but signs are pointing to a cascade of events starting with a minor failure that snowballed into system overload as the rented servers tried to restart themselves in other areas of Amazon's cloud capacity.  The questions being raised though are leading to a darkening of the puffy white cloud computing promise.  Ultimately, though, use of computing in the cloud seems to be a trade-off where you can save money by not owning your own computing infrastructure with the downside that you don't have as much control when something goes wrong.</p>
<h2 id="p2831-renewable">Far-flung Data Centers Could Use Otherwise Unharvestable Renewable Energy For Computation</h2>
<blockquote><div style="text-align: right; width: 100%;">Researchers at Cambridge University want to put data centers in places so remote they aren't on any power grid. Their models indicate that moving data-hungry computation to places such as scorching deserts, windswept peaks, and the middle of the Atlantic Ocean &mdash; all rich in sunlight and wind energy &mdash; could allow this otherwise unharvestable energy to do useful work.<cite>- <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/37460/?a=f" title="Really Remote Data&nbsp;| MIT Technology Review">Really Remote Data</a>, by Christopher Mims, MIT Technology Review</cite></div>
</blockquote>
<p>The second thread comes by way of MIT Technology Review and points to a paper by Sherif Akoush, Ripduman Sohan, Andrew Rice, Andrew W. Moore and Andy Hopper -- all of Cambridge University called <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sa497/akoush-hotos11.pdf" title="Free Lunch: Exploiting Renewable Energy For Computing [PDF]">Free Lunch: Exploiting Renewable Energy For Computing</a>, to be presented at the USENIX-sponsored the <a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/hotos11/" title="HotOS 13">13th Workshop on Hot Topics in Operating Systems</a> next month.  The "Free Lunch" part comes from using renewable energy sources at these various locations to power data centers where compute jobs are shuffled around the locations depending on the available energy -- and consequently computing capacity -- at each center.  A neat idea, and one that is probably valuable for compute-intensive jobs like video conversion and data mining.  </p>

<p>For two entirely different purposes, Facebook and Google released videos recently that give glimpses into what each does to run a data center.  The four-and-a-half-minute Facebook video introduces us to their <a href="http://opencompute.org/" title="Open Compute Project">Open Compute Project</a>: a set of plans for server hardware and for physical buidings to creating the most efficient computer clusters possible.  In the seven-minute Google video, we see part of what Google does to keep data safe that is stored in the cloud (including a pair of hard drive crushing machines!).</p>
