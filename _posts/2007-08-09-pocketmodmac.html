  content: 'This is very cool, thanks for the instructions! It works fine under Leopard
    (10.5.5) for me. One note of advice: if you copy-and-paste the script, you have
    to make sure to replace the funny graphical characters (the x in "2x4" and the
    quotes around "1l,2r,etc.") with their ASCII counterparts, after you paste the
    text in Automator. Also, don''t forget to change the "Pass input:" setting to
    "as arguments"! I made both of these mistakes, but after fixing them, it works
    beautifully.'

  content: "@ZZamboni -- Thanks for trying this out and reporting the issues.  The
    core of the problem is that WordPress's <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wptexturize\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">wptexturize</a> function -- invoked by the theme to pretty up
    the typographical elements of the text -- modifies characters within <code> tags.
    \ I'm using a <blockquote><code> combination because if I were to use a <pre>
    block the shell command would stretch well past the right margin of the browser.
    \ (And if I artificially insert line breaks inside the <pre> block, those line
    breaks would be pasted into the Automator window.)\r\n\r\nI found <span class=\"removed_link\"
    title=\"http://www.planetmike.com/journal/plugins/codequotes/\">PlanetMike CodeQuotes</span>
    will reverse the changes made by wptexturize inside <code> blocks.  I had to make
    one addition to the plugin because <a href=\"http://trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/2.6.2/wp-includes/formatting.php#L24\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">wptexturize</a> was replacing regex <code>/(d+)x(d+)/</code>
    with <code>$1&amp;#215;$2</code>.  So I added this (which will probably also get
    munged by the WordPress wptexturize function): $line = str_replace('&#215;', 'x',$line);\r\n\r\nWhile
    tweaking the article, I also modified the \"Run Script\" automator action graphic
    to highlight the need to modify the \"Pass Input\" parameter.<p style=\"padding:0;margin:0;font-style:italic;\"

<p>This one goes out to all of the MacOS X users out there.  (For the rest of you, why aren't you <a href="http://www.apple.com/getamac/" title="Apple - Get a Mac">switching</a>?)  Perhaps you have seen <a href="http://pocketmod.com/" title="PocketMod: The Free Disposable Personal Organizer">PocketMod</a> -- the origami-like manipulation of an 8 1/2" by 11" piece of paper into an 8-page booklet.</p>
<div style="float: right; width: 415px; padding-left: 15px;"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/pocketmod1.jpg" alt="PocketMod example picture" title="PocketMod example picture" align="right" border="0" width="410" height="306" />Example PocketMod, courtesy of the <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/personaltech/articles/2006/06/25/pda_buffs_go_back_to_basics/" title="PDA buffs go back to basics - The Boston Globe">Boston Globe</a>.</div>
<p>Touted as a way to <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/personaltech/articles/2006/06/25/pda_buffs_go_back_to_basics/" title="PDA buffs go back to basics - The Boston Globe">"get back to the basics" using analog media over digital media</a>, it is a scheme by which you can transform pages of text into a pocket-sized form for carrying around.  Many use it as a way to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090809000000/http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2007/03/18/the-power-of-paper.html" title="The Power of Paper  - Newsweek Enterprise">synchronize their digital to-do lists with the analog world</a>, while others use it <a href="http://www.creativetechs.com/iq/mac_os_x_shortcuts_pocketmod.html" title="CreativeIQ: Mac OS X Shortcuts! A Tiny Guide.">document shortcuts and cheat-sheets</a> in a convenient form.</p>
<p>I'm migrating from <a href="http://www.thinkingrock.com.au/" title="ThinkingRock homepage">Thinking Rock</a> to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070809000000/http://bargiel.home.pl:80/iGTD/" title="iGTD homepage">iGTD</a> as my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done" title="Getting Things Done - Wikipedia">Getting Things Done</a> tool-of-choice.  One of the things I'm missing about Thinking Rock is its built-in ability to create PocketMods for the actions in the GTD system.  The only real easy way to create the PocketMod format was via a Flash applet or a Windows application.  Some have set up <span class="removed_link" title="http://pocketmod.com/bb/comments.php?DiscussionID=27&amp;page=1#Item_0">shell scripts</span> or worked with other programs, but I was looking for something as simple as the MacOS X print dialog box.  And with a little bit of <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2488" title="Automator (software)" rel="homepage" class="zem_slink">Automator</a>, Java, and shell scripting, it is possible!</p>
<h2>Step 1:  Get the "Multivalent" PDF Manipulation Toolkit</h2>
<p>The heavy lifting of this solution uses the <a href="http://multivalent.sourceforge.net/" title="Multivalent homepage">Multivalent PDF Manipulation Toolkit</a>.  This is a Java-based application that perform various actions (impose, compress, uncompress, info, encrypt / decrypt, split and merge, and validate) on PDF documents (as well as other file formats).  It is an open source application available under the GPL license (although <a href="http://multivalent.sourceforge.net/license.html" title="Multivalent license page">some components of Multivalent have commercial use restrictions</a>) available from SourceForge at this download URL: <a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/multivalent/Multivalent20060102.jar?modtime=1136221165&amp;big_mirror=0" title="Download Multivalend20060102.jar">Multivalent20060102.jar</a>.  Download that file and save it somewhere on your hard drive.  You'll need to know the direct path location for the next step.</p>
<h2>Step 2:  Create the Automator Action</h2>
<p>Launch "<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2488" title="Apple - Mac OS X - Automator">Automator</a>" (you'll find it in the Applications folder).  It will start with a new, untitled work document.  From the left-most panel, select "Automator", then from the panel just to the right of that click and drag "Run Shell Script" to the empty document on the right.<br />
<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/automator_drag1.png" alt="Dragging "Run " to empty windows" title="Dragging &#039;Run Shell Script&#039; to empty windows" border="0" width="693" height="415" /></p>
<p>In the 'Run Shell Script' action, change "Pass input" to "as arguments" then replace "cat" in the command box with this (ignoring any line breaks that may appear here -- this text should be entered without line breaks):</p>
<blockquote><p>
<code><br />
cat "$1" > /tmp/temp$$.pdf &amp;&amp; java -classpath [location]/Multivalent20060102.jar tool.pdf.Impose -dim 2x4 -layout "1l,2r,8l,3r,7l,4r,6l,5r" -paper letter -verbose /tmp/temp$$.pdf 2> /tmp/temp$$.err &amp;&amp; open /tmp/temp$$-up.pdf<br />
</code>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Replace [location] with the complete file path where you downloaded the Multivalent20060102.jar file.  The final results should look something like this:<br />
<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/automator_action1.png" alt="Completed action" title="Completed action" border="0" width="653" height="386" /></p>
<p>Now save this as "PocketModMac" in either the "/Library/PDF Services" directory (to make it available to all users of your machine) or to "Library/PDF Services" in your home directory for just you.</p>
<h2>Step 3:  Using PocketModMac</h2>
<p>Using this PocketMod generator is as simple as printing any document to any printer.  In the print dialog box, pull down the PDF menu and select "PocketModMac".<br />
<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/print_dialog1.png" alt="Print Dialog" title="Print Dialog" border="0" width="598" height="553" /></p>
<p>After a few seconds, the Preview application will open up with the PocketMod-ed document.  Print this document as you would to any printer, then follow the directions for folding and cutting the page to create your booklet.<br />
<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/instructions1.png" alt="Folding Instructions" title="Folding Instructions" border="0" width="744" height="452" /></p>
<h2>Troubleshooting and Known Issues</h2>
<p>Using Automator to string together a Unix command line like this is moderately fragile and doesn't provide for a lot of feedback on potential errors.  If it doesn't work for you, one place to look for problems is in the /private/tmp directory for a file called <code>temp[number].err</code>.  The contents of that file may give clues as to what went wrong.</p>
<p>This isn't necessarily a very nice solution because it leaves files laying around in the /private/tmp directory after it is done.  The <code>/etc/periodic/daily/500.daily</code> maintenance script will clean them out automatically after three days, but still -- it is somewhat sloppy to leave them around.</p>
