<p>This started out as a comment to a <a href="http://coppola.rsmart.com/2007/08/14/educational-patents-open-access-journals-and-clashing-values/" title="&#039;Educational Patents, Open Access Journals, and Clashing Values&#039; posting in Chris Coppola&#039;s blog">posting by Chris Coppola</a>, president and co-founder of <a href="http://rsmart.com/" title="rSmart homepage">rSmart Group</a>.  The comment got longer and threaded with yesterday's posting about the nature of BioMed Central, so I moved it to this posting on <acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester"><i>DLTJ</i></acronym>.  For those in the library community who are not familiar with rSmart, it provides commercial support for the <a href="https://www.sakaiproject.org/" title="Sakai Project homepage">Sakai</a> collaboration and learning environment and the <a href="http://www.kuali.org/" title="Kuali Foundation">Kuali</a> administrative systems suite.  rSmart is somewhat equivalent to <a href="http://esilibrary.com/" title="Equinox Software homepage">Equinox Software</a> and <a href="http://liblime.com/" title="LibLime homepage">LibLime</a> in the library automation arena.</p>
<h2>Aligning Clashing Values Under Open Source</h2>
<p>Chris brings up a good point that isn't addressed in my <a href="http://dltj.org/2007/08/clashing-values">earlier</a> <a href="http://dltj.org/2007/08/what-is-biomed-central">postings</a>.  The summation of his post is:</p>
<blockquote><p>we should be careful not to over generalize. There are clashing values between some businesses and the education community. Blackboard might even be the poster child for values that clash. But there are businesses out there that operate with the same collegial cooperation, and share the values of the education community. Indeed some are part of the education community.</p></blockquote>
<p>He's right, and I would propose that what makes rSmart (and Equinox and LibLime and other similar companies) different is a commitment to open source principles.  The values of the business and the values of the academic institution are more closely aligned when the outcome is a better piece of open source software for the business <em>and</em> the academic institution.  As rSmart thrives, so does the underlying open source platforms -- and here is the key -- whether or not consumers of that underlying platform are direct customers of the commercial support entities.</p>
<h2>Aligning Clashing Values Under Open Access</h2>
<p>And just because the world is not the black-and-white place that could be inferred from my previous postings, entities like <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/" title="BioMed Central homepage">BioMed Central</a> and <a href="http://www.plos.org/" title="Public Library of Science homepage">PLoS</a> are aligned to a degree with the (emerging?) academic values of open access.  Part of the "product" that each is selling is the concept of open access, which takes the form of advocacy to members of the academic community and lobbying to political entities.  As the BioMed Central and PLoS thrive, so too one presumes does the concept of open access to journal articles.  To the extent that members of the academic community find merit in the efforts of the activities of the businesses, everyone is happy.  It would seem that the <span class="removed_link" title="http://www2.library.yale.edu/movabletype/scilib/archive/2007/08/library_drops_b_1.html">Yale University libraries performed that calculation and found the equation with BioMed Central lacking</span>.</p>
