  content: Something is quite hosed with the feeds.  Feedburner/Google is returning
    a 404 "Server Not Found" error message.  Please stick with me while I try to sort
    this out.  Thanks, Susan P., for reporting the problem.

  content: Feeds seem to be working again.  <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/feedburner-statistics/browse_thread/thread/19635110165e57a9#"
    rel="nofollow">A posting on the support group</a> suggested deactivating and reactivating
    the MyBrand feature, and that seemed to do the trick.  Please let me know if you
    see anything else.

<p><acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester"><i>DLTJ</i></acronym> uses the <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/home" title="FeedBurner homepage">FeedBurner service</a> to enhance its syndication feeds and gather statistics on readers.  Several years ago, <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.feedburner.com/google">Google acquired FeedBurner</span> and recently has begun the process of <del>forcing</del> -- errr -- <span class="removed_link" title="https://www.google.com/support/feedburner/bin/answer.py?answer=126303"><em>integrating</em> users to the Google account structure</span>.  I completed the process, but it isn't entirely clear that it took hold (my transferred feed isn't showing up in my new Googlized FeedBurner dashboard).  If you used to read <acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester"><i>DLTJ</i></acronym> via an RSS/ATOM reader and noticed that you didn't see this post or any subsequent posts, please let me know.
