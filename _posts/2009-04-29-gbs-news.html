<p>New York Judge <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denny_Chin" title="Wikipedia: Denny Chin">Denny Chin</a> recently issued two rulings in the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081219194925/http://books.google.com/booksrightsholders/" title="Google Book Search Settlement Notice to Rights-holders">Google Book Search settlement</a>.  In the first, he <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/14596133/SDNY-Judge-Chin-Intervention-Denied" title="SDNY Judge Chin: Intervention Denied">'</a> the <a href="http://www.opencontentalliance.org/2009/04/17/internet-archive-files-intervention-request/" title="Internet Archive files Intervention Request; Open Content Alliance (OCA) Blog">request</a> by the Internet Archive to intervene as a defendant in the lawsuit (and thus, presumably, be on firmer founding to guide aspects of the settlement).  In his response, Judge Chin said:<br />
<blockquote>The Court has received requests for pre-motion conferences by the Internet Archive, <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/14227449/Letter-to-Request-Intervention-in-Authors-Guild-v-Google" title="Letter to Request Intervention in Author's Guild v Google">Lewis Hyde, Harry Lewis, and the Open Access Trust</a>, Inc. seeking leave to intervene in this action.  I have construed their letters as motions to intervene, and the motions are denied.  The proposed interveners are, however, free to file objections to the proposed settlement or amicus briefs, either of which must be filed by the May 5, 2009 objection deadline.</p></blockquote>
<p>  (The <a href="http://openaccesstrust.org/" title="Open Access Trust">Open Access Trust</a> is a proposal to form a legal trust for the revenue generated by unclaimed orphan works.)</p>
<p>In the second, Judge Chin <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/14741799/SDNY-Order-Extending-Deadline-to-September-4" title="SDNY - Order Extending Deadline to September 4">granted</a> a four month extension to the deadline for class members to opt out of the settlement or file objections.  The new deadline is now September 4th.  Requests for the extension came from a group of authors (including heirs of Steinbeck) in an <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/14685855/Authors-Letter-Extension-Request" title="Authors Letter Extension Request">April 24th letter</a> and a group of academic authors represented by Berkeley School of Law Professor <a href="http://www.law.berkeley.edu/php-programs/faculty/facultyProfile.php?facID=346" title="Pamela Samuelson Faculty Profile">Pamela Samuelson</a> (who recently wrote <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/04/legally-speaking-the-dead-soul.html" title="Legally Speaking: The Dead Souls of the Google Booksearch Settlement (O'Reilly Radar blog)">an eloquent post about the settlement on the O'Reilly Radar blog</a>).  Attorneys in the case <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/14685856/Ltr-M-Boni-to-J-Chin-42409" title="Ltr - M. Boni to J. Chin - 4.24.09">requested a two month extension</a>.</p>
<p>In related news, the court has received and logged three letters that object to the settlement:  from authors <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/14764020/GBS-Settlement-Objection-Letter-from-Hope-Ryden" title="GBS Settlement Objection Letter from Hope Ryden">Hope Ryden</a> and <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/14764116/GBS-Settlement-Objection-Letter-from-Lee-Killough" title="GBS Settlement Objection Letter from Lee Killough">Lee Killough</a> as well as <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/14764193/GBS-Settlement-Objection-Letter-from-Jenny-Darling-Associates" title="GBS Settlement Objection Letter from Jenny Darling &amp; Associates">Jenny Darling &amp; Associates</a> in Australia.  More may come next week from those anticipating the May 5th deadline, but I expect most will continue to flow in around the new September 4th date.</p>
