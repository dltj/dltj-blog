<p>Learning, Libraries &amp; Technology 2009 Conference will be the tenth anniversary of Ohio&rsquo;s premier higher education conference, previously known as the Ohio Digital Commons for Education Conference.  Although the name might have changed, this year&rsquo;s conference will deliver all the same great professional development and networking opportunities from past conferences, including keynote sessions, vendor exhibits and technology demonstrations. In order to attract as many people as possible to attend this special 10th anniversary conference, organizers are reducing <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.oln.org/conferences/LLT2009/LLT2009fees.php">conference fees</span> to just $195 ($95 for students) for two-day registrations, and $95 ($55 for students) for one-day registrations.</p>
