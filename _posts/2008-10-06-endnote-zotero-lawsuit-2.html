  content: "Yes, CSL is developed independently of Zotero. But Zotero developers have
    contributed to CSL. \r\n\r\nThe timeline is roughly: \r\n\r\nI created the first
    version of CSL and released it along with the first citeproc xslt release.  I
    did this before I'd even heard about Zotero, and it had some distant connection
    to earlier work on similar XML citation styling languages by Markus Hoenicka (from
    RefDB) and Peter Flynn.\r\n\r\nA Zotero developer subsequently built a javascript
    implementation of a CSL-processor for Zotero, not long before they released the
    first public betas. \r\n\r\nBased on this implementation experience, we (along
    with some other developers) bounced around some ideas for improving CSL. The current
    version of CSL is thus rather different (and better) than the first one, and reflects
    a collaborative effort.\r\n\r\nThe key goals behind CSL have always been that
    it is both open and application-independent. So I hope at some point in the not-too-distant
    future to be seeing support for CSL in a lot of different environments; not just
    Zotero."

<p>This is a brief update on the EndNote/Zotero lawsuit.  The story thus far:  The Thomson Scientific division of <a href="http://www.thomsonreuters.com/" title="Thomson Reuters homepage">Reuters</a>, maintainer of the <a href="http://www.endnote.com/" title="EndNote software homepage">EndNote</a> software, is <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2008/09/17/Reuters_Says_George_Mason_University_Is_Handing_Out_Its_Proprietary_Software.htm" title="Courthouse News Service story">suing</a> <a href="http://www.gmu.edu/" title="George Mason University homepage">George Mason University</a> over the upcoming release of <a href="http://www.zotero.org/" title="Zotero homepage">Zotero</a>, the Firefox plugin for managing citations.  More specifically, <a href="/article/zotero-lawsuit-extracts/">the complaint</a> filed in Virginia state courts says "GMU reverse engineered or de-compiled the EndNote Software and the proprietary .ens files contained within the EndNote Software in order to determine how to convert the EndNote Software .ens style files into the open source Zotero .csl style files, in direct and material violation of the [sitewide] License Agreement [signed by GMU]."  (Note, though, as <a href="http://community.muohio.edu/blogs/darcusb/archives/2008/09/27/lawsuit" title="Lawsuit discussion on Bruce D&#039;Arcus blog">others</a> <a href="http://numinoria.blogspot.com/2008/09/if-you-cant-beat-em-sue-em.html" title="if you can&#039;t beat &#039;em, sue &#039;em">have</a> <a href="http://jasonpuckett.net/2008/09/26/thomson-suing-george-mason-u-over-zotero/" title="Thomson suing George Mason U over Zotero">pointed</a> <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/thomson-suing-zotero-more-info-and-more-thoughts/" title="Thomson Suing Zotero: More Info and More Thoughts">out</a>, Zotero is not converting EndNote Style files to <a href="http://xbiblio.sourceforge.net/csl/" title="Citation Style Language homepage">Citation Style Language</a> (CSL) files. ((<a href="http://xbiblio.sourceforge.net/csl/" title="Citation Style Language homepage">Citation Style Language</a> is an "XML language to describe bibliographic and citation formatting."  It is used by Zotero and other citation management tools.))  It is parsing EndNote Style files and using them internally along side style definitions defined using CSL.  Or, at least it was until the <span class="removed_link" title="https://www.zotero.org/trac/changeset/3451">function was removed from the code</span>.)</p>
<h2 id="endnote-style-license">EndNode Styles Site now behind a Click-Through License</h2>
<p><acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester"><i>DLTJ</i></acronym> reader Rick <a href="/article/endnote-zotero-lawsuit/#comment-33953">reports</a> that the <a href="http://www.endnote.com/support/enstyles.asp" title="EndNote Styles site">EndNote Output Styles site</a> now redirects to a <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.endnote.com/support/enstyles-terms.asp">click-through license</span> that you must accept.  Presumably, if you accept it, you get to see the directory of styles; I haven't clicked through it, however.  As of the time of this posting, the text of the click-through license says:</p>
<blockquote><p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To download EndNote output styles, connection files, import filters, templates and the user manual you must agree to the following terms.</font></b><br />

<p>This seems a little like closing the barn door after the horse has gone. ((An explanation of the clich&eacute;  <a href="http://www.clichesite.com/content.asp?which=tip+2545" title="">Why close the barn door after the horse is gone?</a>))  And it opens up all sorts of questions like:  What about all of the EndNote Style files that are <a href="http://www.library.uq.edu.au/research-support/output-styles" title="EndNote Styles">posted</a> <a href="http://www.interscience.wiley.com/jendnotes/" title="Wiley InterScience :: EndNote Reference Style Files">on</a> <a href="http://journals.iucr.org/services/endnotestyle.html" title="IUCr EndNote output style">other</a> <a href="http://www.rsc.org/Publishing/ReSourCe/AuthorGuidelines/ElectronicFiles/Templates/endnote.asp" title="RSC Endnote Style Files">sites</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=filetype%3Aens" title="Google search for filetype &#039;ens&#039;">all over the web</a>?  Do these sites now need to put their .ens files behind similar click-through licenses?  Does the license apply to EndNote Style files that I create myself using the EndNote software?</p>
<h2 id="forum-gripes">"Gripes About the New Contract for Downloads"</h2>
<p>This change has already prompted <a href="http://forums.thomsonscientific.com/ts/board/message?board.id=en-general&amp;thread.id=649" title="">these comments</a> by <a href="http://forums.thomsonscientific.com/ts/profile?user.id=1405" title="View Profile for noksagt">an EndNote user</a> on the <a href="http://forums.thomsonscientific.com/ts/board?board.id=en-general" title="EndNote General - Thomson Reuters Forums">EndNote support forums</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I'm not very amused by the new covenants to download style files. I realize that a recent lawsuit against a competitor may have spooked people, but I don't understand several issues:</p>
<p>Can these files be used by users of the EndNote trial as part of their evaluation process? The first term of the contract seems like it may prohibit that.</p>
<p>Why is the user manual not made available to everyone? It can be useful prior to the purchase of EndNote for informational evaluation. I do not see what value it has to your competitors, and I see only advantages for EndNote in increasing the distribution of the manual.</p>
<p>Why is the word "modify" in covenant 2? You do not ship every output styles, connection files, import filters, or template for all needs. Fortunately, EndNote has excellent editors to fill in these gaps. Can I no longer modify the components of EndNote for use form within EndNote, even though I have a license? If so, this seems to be a major loss of value!</p>
<p>Another common practice that is prohibited now is sharing a subset of files with other EndNote users.  My previous research group had styles of journals we used and connection files for databases we used in a common location. This made it very easy to make a minimal installation of EndNote on new workstatons and also to grab missing files without slogging through the online repository.  Many other groups and libraries seem to do something similar.  Again, this practice would make EndNote more valuable.</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="michael-feldstein-thoughts">More on What Zotero Does</h2>
<p>Michael Feldstein has some thoughts about what Zotero is actually doing in relation to the EndNote Style files:</p>
<blockquote><p>Unfortunately, [the Reuters lawsuit] is also based on claims that appear to be factually false. Apparently, the Zotero team <em>did</em>&nbsp;create their own style format and <em>is</em>&nbsp;crowd-sourcing the creation of import styles. As you can see from <a href="https://www.zotero.org/trac/ticket/704">this Zotero developer discussion thread</a>, the developers considered and explicitly rejected supporting the redistribution of Thomson-supplied EndNote conversion files. In fact, while Zotero can read EndNote style files, it specifically does not convert them into Zotero's own format, in large part to discourage the redistribution (deliberately or accidentally) of Thomson-created files. What the import feature <em>does</em>&nbsp;facilitate is (a) users who have already licensed EndNote and want to migrate to Zotero can use the EndNote styles that they have already paid for, and (b) Zotero users can take advantage of the EndNote import styles that individual journal publishers (as opposed to Thomson itself) make available for the convenience of their subscribers. These uses strike me as totally within bounds.</p></blockquote>
<p>One minor quibble is that I don't think Zotero created its own style format. <a href="http://xbiblio.sourceforge.net/csl/" title="Citation Style Language homepage">Citation Style Language</a>, according to the description on its homepage, was "developed alongside <a href="http://xbiblio.sourceforge.net/citeproc/" title="CiteProc">CiteProc</a>."  Other than that, I highly recommend reading <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/thomson-suing-zotero-more-info-and-more-thoughts/" title="Thomson Suing Zotero: More Info and More Thoughts">his thoughtful analysis</a>.</p>
<h2 id="lawsuit-extension">Extension Granted</h2>
<p>In a minor matter, according the Virginia Courts Case Information website, <a href="http://www.courts.state.va.us/courts/circuit/Richmond/home.html" title="Richmond Circuit Court">Richmond City Circuit Civil Division</a> judge C.
