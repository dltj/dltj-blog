<p>Earlier this week, <acronym title="Library and Information Technology Association">LITA</acronym> <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/lita/litaevents/litacamp/index.cfm">announced</span> its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference" title="Unconference" rel="wikipedia" class="zem_slink">unconference</a> event: <a href="http://litacamp.pbwiki.com/" title="LITA Camp wiki">LITACamp</a>.  The meeting is scheduled for May 7-8, 2009 at the <a href="http://www.oclc.org/conferencecenter/default.htm" title="The Conference Center at OCLC">OCLC Conference Center in Dublin, Ohio</a>. <!--more--> <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=115638068338367382765.000451c13722d816473a8&amp;ll=40.102137,-83.125219&amp;spn=0.008239,0.015643&amp;t=h&amp;z=16" title="Map of the OCLC Conference Center and surrounding facilities">(Map of conference center and surrounding facilities.)</a></p>
<p>For those that don't know, the unconference meeting format is one where the topics are picked by those that show up, and those that show up play an active role in creating the meeting.  Other than the two keynotes (<a href="http://www.jfwilliams.com/" title="Joan Frye Williams&#039; homepage">Joan Frye Williams</a> and <a href="http://www.blyberg.net/" title="John Blyberg&#039;s homepage">John Blyberg</a>) the schedule of meetings is created by the will of the group present at the time.</p>
<p>Cost varies by standing in LITA/<acronym title="American Library Association">ALA</acronym> ($150 for LITA members, $210 for ALA members, and $290 for non-ALA members).  This registration fee includes a light breakfast on both days and a lunch on Thursday, plus free WiFi at the conference center.  The <a href="http://litacamp.pbwiki.com/" title="LITA Camp wiki">meeting site</a> has more information. </p>
