  content: Man,  I hope you *do* put up the audio, because I have no idea what your
    presentation was about without it, and I'd really like to know.

  content: Yeah, my presentation style has drifted towards large, iconic pictures
    supporting the concepts I'm actually speaking about.  I'm listening to the audio
    now and I think it will be usable.  (I overestimated the gain required to record
    in the room so the levels are very overdriven.  Hopefully some work in Audacity
    will clean it up.)  I'll see what I can do tomorrow...

<p>I had the pleasure of presenting at the <a href="http://www.wright.edu/ohecc/" title="OHECC 2009 Conference homepage">2009 meeting of the Ohio Higher Education Computing Council</a> (OHECC) on OhioLINK's plans for a new discovery layer.  Included below is a web version of the presentation slides and links to more information.  <del datetime="2009-03-31T00:43:46+00:00">I also attempted to record the audio from the presentation; if that is of an acceptable quality, I'll add it here and synchronize it to the slide playback.</del>The audio has now been added to the presentation on SlideShare and is <a href="http://dltj.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/OHECC-presentation-on-Discovery-Layer.mp3" title="MP3 recording of presentation audio">available separately</a>.</p>
