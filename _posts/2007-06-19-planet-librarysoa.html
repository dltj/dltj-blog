    <strong>Planet Library SOA...</strong>

    Peter Murray (aka The Jester) has been kind enough to setup a new library SOA aggregation at Planet Library SOA. So, you growing masses of library architecture enthusiasts, please feel free to converge there and slurp from the fountain of library SOAne...

  content: "<!--%kramer-pre%-->You can of course read more as well in my (sometimes
    overlapping) blog categories on Service-Oriented Architecture and Web Services.
    \ As well, Peter Murray has been advocating for library SOA, and has set up an
    aggregator to gather various blog postings on the topic:  http://librarysoa.dltj.org/
    \ Finally, here's the full sidebar that I wrote:  Library SOA  In the library
    world, we are often bombarded with new technology terms and ideas.<!--%kramer-post%-->"

<p>I am pleased to announce the formation of Planet Library SOA -- an aggregation of blog postings and resources related to the application of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture" title="Wikipedia entry on Service-Oriented Architecture">Service-Oriented Architecture</a> (SOA) software paradigm to library systems.  You can follow the topic by <span class="removed_link" title="http://librarysoa.dltj.org/">reading the aggregation website</span>, but the best way to follow along is by subscribing to one of the feeds (<a href="http://librarysoa.dltj.org/atom.xml">atom</a>, <a href="http://librarysoa.dltj.org/rss10.xml">rss1.0</a> or <a href="http://librarysoa.dltj.org/rss20.xml">rss2.0</a>) in your favorite newsreader.  Those in the conversation at the beginning are Eric Schnell, Lorcan Dempsey, Richard Akerman, Stephen Anthony, and the Talis corporate blog.  If you are looking for an introduction to the SOA topic with a slant towards library services, I humbly suggest you read my series on <acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester"><i>DLTJ</i></acronym> starting with <a href="http://dltj.org/2006/09/defining-soa-by-analogy/">Defining &ldquo;Service Oriented Architecture&rdquo; by Analogy</a>.<br />

<h2>Adding Your Voice</h2>
<p>If you publish on the same topic and would like to be added to the Planet Library SOA aggregator, please let me know:<br />
<!--cforms2--></p>
<p>Resources tagged with '<a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/librarysoa" title="Pages tagged with &amp;quot;librarysoa&amp;quot; on del.icio.us">librarysoa</a>' in del.icio.us will also appear in the aggregator.</p>
<h2>Mechanics</h2>
<p><i>Planet Library SOA</i> is created using the <a href="http://www.planetplanet.org/" title="Planet Feed Reader">Planet</a> software -- a tool for aggregating and republishing RSS feeds.  In the case where the contributor runs the WordPress software, <i>Planet Library SOA</i> subscribes to the RSS feed of a category or tag from that blog.  In the case where the contributor runs the Movable Type software, a Yahoo! Pipe is used to extract SOA-related postings from the blog's general feed.  (For example, see this <span class="removed_link" title="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.edit?_id=rtYodYEe3BG6g7sVJhOy0Q">Yahoo! Pipe for Lorcan Dempsey's blog</span>.  My gratitude goes out to Stephen Anthony for <a href="http://ea.typepad.com/enterprise_abstraction/2007/06/yahoo_pipes.html" title="Enterprise Abstraction: Yahoo Pipes">his example on how to get Yahoo! Pipes to extract content from feeds</a> and Ryan Gallagher for <span class="removed_link" title="http://discuss.pipes.yahoo.com/Message_Boards_for_Pipes/threadview?m=tm&amp;bn=pip-DeveloperHelp&amp;tid=905&amp;mid=1632&amp;tof=2&amp;rt=2&amp;frt=2&amp;off=1">a workaround</span> to <span class="removed_link" title="http://discuss.pipes.yahoo.com/Message_Boards_for_Pipes/threadview?m=tm&amp;bn=pip-DeveloperHelp&amp;tid=905&amp;mid=1332&amp;tof=2&amp;rt=2&amp;frt=2&amp;off=1">a bug in Pipes</span>.)</p>
