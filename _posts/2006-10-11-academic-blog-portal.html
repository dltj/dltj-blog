<p>DLTJ is now listed...how about your blog?</p>
<blockquote><h2><a href="http://acrlblog.org/2006/10/04/calling-all-academic-librarian-bloggers/" title="ACRLog  &amp;raquo; Blog Archive   &amp;raquo; Calling All Academic Librarian Bloggers">Calling All Academic Librarian Bloggers</a></h2>
<p>A few months ago I came across a just developing project of <a href="http://www.henryfarrell.net" title="Henry Farrell&#039;s homepage">Henry Farrell</a>, Assistant Professor at the Department of Political Science and Elliott School of International Affairs of the George Washington University. He was in the initial stages of developing a rather comprehensive wiki project called <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.academicblogs.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">The Academic Blog Portal</span>, a directory to the academic blogosphere. The Portal is a disciplinary guide to academic/faculty blogs across the "<span class="removed_link" title="http://www.academicblogs.net/wiki/index.php/Invisible_College">invisible college</span>."</p>
<p>The first version of Farrell&rsquo;s project offered just one librarian blog, and it was included in the &ldquo;library science&rdquo; category. After some correspondence with Farrell he agreed that a unique category for academic librarians was needed. The library science category would be designated for blogs by faculty at LIS programs. A new <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.academicblogs.net/wiki/index.php/University_Librarians">University Librarians</span> category under "Other Parts of the Academy" was created specifically for blogs maintained by college and university librarians.</p>
