<p>About two years ago I wrote a blog post wondering if <a href="/article/outsource-digital-bits/" title="Can We Outsource the Preservation of Digital Bits? | Disruptive Library Technology Jester">we could outsource the preservation of digital bits</a>.  What prompted that blog post was an announcement from Iron Mountain of a <a href="http://www.ironmountain.com/news/2009/impr02232009.asp" title="Iron Mountain Digital Introduces the Industry&rsquo;s First Enterprise Solution for Cloud-Based File Archiving">Cloud-Based File Archiving</a> service.  Since then there have been a number of other services that have sprung up that are more attuned to the needs of cultural heritage communities (<a href="http://duracloud.org/" title="DuraCloud | Duraspace">DuraCloud</a> and <a href="http://chronopolis.sdsc.edu/" title="Chronopolis -- Digital Preservation Program">Chronopolis</a> come to mind), but I have wondered if the commercial sector had a way to do this cheaply and efficiently.  The answer to that question is "maybe not" as <a href="http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?id=1626215" title="Iron Mountain Becomes Third Provider to Exit Public Cloud Storage Market | Gartner Group Research">Iron Mountain has told Gartner Group</a> (<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/iron_mountain_becomes_third__211632.pdf" title="Iron Mountain Becomes Third Provider to Exit Public Cloud Storage Market [PDF]">PDF archive</a>) that it is closing its <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.ironmountain.com/digital-archiving/inactive-data-file-archiving.html">Virtual File Store</span> services and its <a href="http://www.ironmountain.com/storage/storage-as-a-service.html" title="Storage as a Service, STaaS Storage Outsourcing, Data Storage Solution | Iron Mountain">Archive Service Platform</a>.</p>
<p>The Gartner analysis goes on to say: "Virtual File Store customers that stay with Iron Mountain will be transferred to a higher-value offering, File System Archiving (FSA) in 2012. The new offering will be a hybrid that leverages policy-based archiving on site and in the cloud with indexing and classification capabilities."  <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/04/11/iron_mountain_exits_public_storage_cloud/" title="Bruised Iron Mountain gives up on storage cloud | The Register">The Register has more details and speculation </a> about what happened.  As always, the full story might be more interesting that what the news reports are saying.  In any case -- just to close this loop -- if you were thinking of trying this particular option, think no further.</p>
