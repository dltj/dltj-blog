  content: My daughter had one of her birthday parties at the library I manage.  My
    father in law had a birthday party at it too.  It all worked very well, especially
    as we are blessed with lots of space and (outside of opening hours) lots of car
    park spaces.  It's fair to say, though, that these parties were held while we
    were closed and we were careful to clear up all our mess ... but, yes, it's practical.

    host the party certainly helps with mess and noise.

  content: Great link, Warren!  I wonder how that pilot turned out as well.  I don't
    know anyone at the Ottawa Public Library, but I'll drop them a note via their
    web feedback form and see if they published their findings anywhere.

<p>Do public libraries host birthday parties for children as part of their programming?  I was with my son at a party for one of his friends a local bouncy inflatables place and happened to be thinking about library stuff while waiting for him to finish bouncing around.  Suddenly (for me, at least) the two topics came together.  A quick <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ie=UTF-8#hl=en&output=search&sclient=psy-ab&q=library%20birthday%20parties&oq=&gs_l=&pbx=1&fp=54147a6c24560a3&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.,cf.osb&biw=1235&bih=868">Google search for "library birthday parties"</a> shows one promising hit <a href="http://cambridge.ccfls.org/preschool-library-birthday-party/" title="Cambridge Springs Public Library &Acirc;&raquo; Preschool Library Birthday Party">at the Cambridge Springs Public Library</a> but the rest seemed to be birthday parties <em>for</em> libraries or librarian-themed birthday parties.  My son gave a noncommittal shrug when I asked him if he wanted his next party at the local library branch -- that may be why they are not so common, but I wondered if anyone else had heard of libraries doing this.</p>
