<p>Although <a href="/article/seeking-soc-applicants/">we were a little concerned right about this time last week</a>, you came through with a wonderful suite of applications with <a href="/category/google-soc/">OhioLINK as the mentoring organization</a> for the <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/" title="Google Summer of Code - Google Code">Google Summer of Code</a>.  In the end, we are blown away not only by the increase in quantity over last year, but also the quality as well.  We received seven for the video snapshot idea, five for the grid-based bulk video conversion tool, one each for the JPIP-based disseminator and applet client, plus a half-dozen proposals for things we didn't have on <span class="removed_link" title="http://drc-dev.ohiolink.edu/wiki/ProjectIdeas">our list</span>.</p>
<p>We've got four mentors right now looking through the applications and I am recruiting a few members from the Ohio Supercomputer Center to help with the array of grid-based proposals.  So to everyone that applied &mdash; thank you! &mdash; and relax for a little bit while we work through your applications.
