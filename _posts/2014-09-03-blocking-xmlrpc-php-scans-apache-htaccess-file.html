  content: This was just what I needed... I had previously blocked this with the Files
    directive, but it was still killing the CPU.  This is much better.  Thanks!

  content: Good point, Marcus -- it would be much better to use firewall rules to
    prevent this kind of activity from reaching the web server at all.  The fail2ban
    wiki has more details about using it to <a href="http://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Category:HTTP"

  content: "Hi, this worked for me. I can see in my access log it returns a 403 so
    it shouldn't kill my php process. However, it might create huge log files right,
    or do those guys stop pinging me after a while? Otherwise I should just block
    that particular IP address?\r\n\r\nThanks"

  content: In my experience, whoever was doing it gave up after a while.  I left the
    rule in, but I stopped seeing the scans.  In my case it was coming from a number
    of IP addresses, so there wasn't just one that I could block.

<p>Someone out there on the internet is repeatedly hitting this blog's /xmlrpc.php service, probably looking to enumerate the user accounts on the blog as a precursor to a password scan (as described in <a href="http://www.saotn.org/huge-increase-wordpress-xmlrpc-php-post-requests/" title="Huge increase in WordPress xmlrpc.php POST requests | Sysadmins of the North">Huge increase in WordPress xmlrpc.php POST requests</a> at Sysadmins of the North).  My access logs look like this:</p>
<pre lang="text">
176.227.196.86 - - [04/Sep/2014:02:18:19 +0000] "POST /xmlrpc.php HTTP/1.0" 200 291 "-" "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible: MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0)"

<p>By itself, this is just annoying -- but the real problem is that the PHP stack is getting invoked each time to deal with the request, and at several requests per second from different hosts this was putting quite a load on the server.  I decided to fix the problem with a slight variation from what is suggested in the Sysadmins of the North blog post.  This addition to the .htaccess file at the root level of my WordPress instance rejects the connection attempt at the Apache level rather than the PHP level:</p>
<pre lang="text">
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} =/xmlrpc.php [NC]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} .*Mozilla\/4.0\ \(compatible:\ MSIE\ 7.0;\ Windows\ NT\ 6.0.*
RewriteRule .* - [F,L]
</pre>
<p>Which means:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the requested path is /xmlrpc.php, and</li>
<li>you are sending this particular agent string, then</li>
<li>send back a 403 error message and don't bother processing any more Apache rewrite rules.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you need to use this yourself, you might find that the HTTP_USER_AGENT string has changed.  You can copy the user string from your Apache access logs, but remember to preface each space or each parenthesis with a backslash.</p>
