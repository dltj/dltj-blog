<p>As the saying, <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00E7DE113FF937A25751C1A9669C8B63&#038;sec=&#038;spon=&#038;partner=permalink&#038;exprod=permalink" title="Cartoon Captures Spirit of the Internet  - New York Times">now a part of Internet lore</a>, goes:  "On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog."  That may be true, but now we must add: "But we do know if you are from a major news organization or corporation."</p>
<p>Wired magazine <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140209203337/http://www.wired.com/politics/onlinerights/news/2007/08/wiki_tracker?currentPage=all" title="Wired News:  See Who&#039;s Editing Wikipedia - Diebold, the CIA, a Campaign">reports</a> on the efforts of <a href="http://virgil.gr" title="VIRGIL.GRiffith">Virgil</a> Griffith to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130510070028/http://wikiscanner.virgil.gr/" title="List anonymous wikipedia edits from interesting organizations">expose the source of anonymous edits to Wikipedia</a>.  In Virgil's words, "I came up with the idea when I heard about Congressmen getting caught for white-washing their wikipedia pages."  So he created a searchable database of anonymous edits to Wikipedia pages indexed by the IP address of the computer that made the edit.  By cross-referencing those edits with the database of IP addresses assigned to organizations, one can speculate with some certainty about who made the edit -- or at least the organization responsible for the IP address of the person who made the edit.  There is a list of interesting examples of wikiscanner results along the right side of the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130510070028/http://wikiscanner.virgil.gr/" title="List anonymous wikipedia edits from interesting organizations">wikiscanner homepage</a>, and Wired Magazine is inviting users to <a href="http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/wikiwatch/" title="List of interesting Wikipedia edits on Wired Blogs">submit interesting examples</a> as well.</p>
<p>This is an interesting project, but it is not without faults.  First, non-anonymous edits -- that is, when a user signs into Wikipedia -- are not tracked.  Since account registrations are free and not tied to a particular IP address, edits by an organization can be "masked" behind a slew of pseudo-anonymous accounts.  (For instance, the <span class="removed_link" title="http://wikiscanner.virgil.gr/f.php?ip1=192.153.30.0-255&amp;ip2=&amp;ip3=&amp;ip4=">list of edits for the range of IP addresses assigned to the OhioLINK central offices</span> does not include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?limit=50&#038;title=Special%3AContributions&#038;contribs=user&#038;target=DataGazetteer&#038;namespace=0&#038;year=&#038;month=-1" title="Wikipedia edits for Peter Murray">edits made when I was logged into to my Wikipedia account</a>.)  Second, Virgil is presumably using a recent snapshot of the IP assignments database.  Since IP address assignments can change over time, a current assignee could be implicated by the changes of the previous owner.  Third, the whole system can be thwarted by <a href="http://tor.eff.org/" title="Tor: anonymity online (homepage)">systems</a> and services that mask the IP address of the machine being used.  So the credibility of the anonymous edits database is about the same as that of Wikipedia itself -- good enough for most uses, but not extremely high.</p>
