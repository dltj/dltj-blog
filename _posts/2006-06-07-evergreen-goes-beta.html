<p>I've got a ton of work to do, but I couldn't let this announcement from Brad LaJeunesse via <span class="removed_link" title="http://lists.webjunction.org/wjlists/publib/2006-June/098898.html">Dusty Gres on Pub4Lib</span> via Karen Schneider on the new<a href="http://listserv.nd.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A0=NGC4LIB" title="302 Found">NGC4LIB list</a> go by without comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The Evergreen software development team is proud to announce the Evergreen ILS Beta release. Evergreen is an open-source ILS being developed by the <a href="http://www.georgialibraries.org/public/pines.html" title="302 Found">Georgia Public Library Service for PINES</a>, a consortium of over 250 public libraries. The Evergreen ILS is scheduled to go into production in PINES this fall.

<a href="http://open-ils.org/blog/?p=57" title="Evergreen has reached Beta &amp;#8211; evergreen-ils blog">The link in the open-ils blog</a> has more details with another <a href="http://open-ils.org/blog/?p=58" title="Fresh Evergreen Beta Cut (version Beta .05) &amp;#8211; evergreen-ils blog">message posted today about a new beta</a>.  (Geez, guys -- in the two weeks between releases you not only fixed bugs but also made enhancements in cataloging and added a more powerful Z39.50 client?  What are you going to do for an <i>encore</i>?)</p>
<p>I think this will be the start of a truly disrupted Integrated Library System marketplace.  Emphasis is on <em>think</em> at the moment because: a) I haven't downloaded and tried out Evergreen myself; and b) it's only a beta after all, so there are probably pieces to be developed to bring it fully up-to-speed.  But if an open source ILS on the scale of a statewide resource sharing consortium can develop a community of supportive users, it is hard to imagine what the boundaries will be.</p>
<p>In the meantime:  congratulations, PINES!  Nice work!</p>
