  content: "That is an interesting part, I agree. \r\n\r\nIt makes a certain sort
    of sense to equate streaming to 'public performance'..... but 'public performance'
    means the same thing to me as 'public display' when talking about videos. \r\n\r\nBut
    apparently it means something different in copyright/IP, since if I'm understanding
    right, the judge decided streaming was 'public performance' which the defendent
    had the right to do, but not 'public display' which the defendent did not have
    the right to do. \r\n\r\nAnyone have any idea what things constitute 'public display'
    vs 'public performance' and what the difference is, when it comes to a moving
    image with sound?"

  content: "PS: It also seems to me that \"universities will have a little more breathing
    room for using media,\" only unless/until the licensors change their contracts,
    at least for future purchases!\r\n\r\nThe judge decided that a right to \"public
    performance\" included streaming. Assuming that other judges agree, this means
    if someone sold you the right to \"public performance\", you can stream. \r\n\r\nBut
    there's absolutely nothing stopping them from changing their contracts to be very
    explicit that they are selling you the right to only specific kinds of \"public
    performance\"  not including streaming. I'm sure their lawyers could work out
    the language (although if they're not careful, they might also end up prohibiting,
    say, streaming to a single on-campus classroom from a central video server. Or
    they might intend to prohibit that too, who knows. Got to pay extra for that,
    doncha know.)\r\n\r\nAnything not covered by the \"first sale doctrine\" or fair
    use, is subject to what they specifically license you to do by contract. If the
    judge decides the contract covered a use they don't want, they can change the
    contract. At least for physical media you purchased, I don't think they can _retroactively_
    change the contract, only for new things you purchase once they change. (For electronic
    content we typically license on a year-by-year basis instead of buying outright,
    they can change the contract offered at the end of the current one, if not earlier)."

  content: Jonathan -- your comment about the difference between 'public display'
    versus 'public performance' made me notice the title of this post...notably that
    it was inaccurate when referring to the equivalence of streaming and "public display".  I've
    corrected the title and inserted an update at the bottom that at least gives the
    U.S. Code definitions of "public display" and "public performance" as enacted
    by Congress.  Unfortunately, the text of those definitions does little to explain
    the differences between display and performance for motion pictures.  The distinction
    might rest on the word "copy" in the definition of display.

  content: Yes, I think you can bet on the fact that the license agreements for motion
    picture media purchases are going to get a little longer as a result of this decision.  But
    in your last paragraph I think you have it wrong way around -- contract law trumps
    the rights given in copyright law.  And purchase of the DVD does not necessarily
    extend public performance rights; that is usually something else that needs to
    be purchased.  That is the meaning behind the classic "FBI Warning!" notifications
    at the front of movies.

    rights (but nothing else) in the _absence_ of a contract saying anything one way
    or another. \r\n\r\nOf course a contract can give you additional rights that you
    did NOT have under fair use or first sale doctrine -- and that's what you'd need
    for generalized public performance/display rights. \r\n\r\nCan a contract limit
    rights you otherwise would have had under fair use or first sale doctrine, if
    you had not had a contract saying otherwise? I  _think_ the answer is \"it depends\",
    but I'm not really sure."

  content: Ah, I see what you are saying.  I think a contract does limit rights that
    you would have otherwise had.  I think a good example is that of interlibrary
    loan rights for articles in digital formats, especially when contracts stipulate
    that you have to turn the digital article into paper form and scan the paper version
    before sending it on to the requesting library.

  content: "This stuff gets tricky. I'm not sure how it works, but I'm not sure your
    example is of the genre we're talking to. Do you have the legal right under fair
    use to send copies of an electronic document to other libraries for ILL, if the
    contract says _nothing_ about it?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure. I'm not sure _anyone's_
    sure!  \r\n\r\nIf you _do_ have that legal right under fair use, but a contract
    tries to tell you you can't do it, if it came to court, might the court decide
    you can do it under fair use despite the contract?  I am not entirely sure, but
    the answer might indeed be 'no' as you suggest, an expert lawyer would know more.
    \r\n\r\nBut to begin with, I am not sure it's clear if you'd have that fair use
    right if the contract said nothing one way or the other about it. I think you
    possibly would NOT.  (for one thing, the first sale doctrine does not apply to
    licensed electronic copies, like it does to purchased print copies. ). This stuff
    gets really complicated fast."

  content: "It is admittedly very tricky, and very easy to get outside my own area
    of firm expertise.  The key seems to be how to apply analog practices to a digital
    world when we know they don't fit exactly.  It has been accepted practice to deliver
    photocopied versions of articles via interlibrary loan.  There was some pushback
    when digital delivery services like Ariel came along and removed the postal mail
    part of the process, but then digital delivery -- even directly to the patron
    -- was acceptable to copyright holders (e.g. publishers).  I guess the reasoning
    was that the scanned version wasn't a clean replica, that there was still a lot
    of \"friction\" in the process of scanning articles, and that libraries were taking
    steps to only reproduce \"reasonable\" amounts out of publications.  End-to-end
    digital delivery removed significant parts of the friction of a transaction and
    dramatically improved the quality of the copy the requesting patron received.
    \ That is where trying to reuse past practices in the analog world have run afoul
    of the digital world.\r\n\r\nIn any case, and I didn't say it before so I'll say
    it here, <em>kudos</em> to UCLA and AVP/AIME for testing and pushing back on the
    boundaries.  Clarity has long been needed in this area, and if it doesn't come
    from the legislative branch of government  it must come from the judicial branch."

<p><em><img alt="NOTE! " src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/note.png" style="float:left;"/>The title of this post was updated (replacing "Display" with "Performance") a day after it was originally published.  See the update at the bottom of the post for more details.</em><br />
<br style="clear:both;" /><br />
Last week a federal district court in California decided in favor of the University of California defendants in a lawsuit brought by Ambrose Video Publishing (AVP) and the Association for Information Media and Equipment (AIME).  A majority of the decision hinged around whether the plaintiffs had "standing" to bring the suit, and commentary by <a href="http://blogs.library.duke.edu/scholcomm/2011/10/04/streaming-video-case-dismissed/" title="Streaming video case dismissed | Scholarly Communications @ Duke">Kevin Smith</a> and <a href="http://policynotes.arl.org/?p=385" title="A Copyright Victory: Video Vendor Case Dismissed! | ARL Policy Notes">ARL</a> go into more detail about that.  The bit that I found interesting was reasoning by the judge that equated "public performance" rights with "streaming."  Far down in the judge's decision was this line of reasoning:</p>
<blockquote><p>
AVP alleges that Defendants&rsquo; use of the DVDs (streaming them on the UCLA intranet) infringed on multiple exclusive rights that AVP has over the DVDs. These exclusive rights included the rights to control copying, public performance, public display, and public distribution. (Id.) Defendants argue that AVP (or &ldquo;Ambrose&rdquo;) does not state a claim for violation of AVP&rsquo;s exclusive rights to publicly perform, publicly display, distribute, and copy under the Copyright Act because: (1) AVP granted Defendants the right to publicly perform the DVDs at issue; (2) UCLA&rsquo;s streaming practice is not a &ldquo;public display&rdquo; under the Copyright Act;1 (3) there are no allegations that UCLA distributed copies of the DVD, as &ldquo;streaming&rdquo; is not distribution, and (4) any unauthorized copying was an incidental &ldquo;fair use&rdquo; under the Copyright Act and therefore permissible.</p>
<p>AVP argues that Defendants&rsquo; copying the DVD in a way that changes the format of the DVD to a digital format for use on the internet violates AVP&rsquo;s rights under the copyright law.  As to Defendants&rsquo; fair use argument regarding the making of unauthorized copies, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants&rsquo; use is not fair use because Defendants knew that their license was limited and did not provide for streaming (and therefore incidental uses of the streaming practice such as copying) of the DVDs.</p>
<h2>(1) Publicly Perform</h2>
<p> AVP concedes that it licensed Defendants to &ldquo;publicly perform&rdquo; the DVD. At oral argument, AVP conceded that within the scope of the right to publicly perform the DVD is Defendants&rsquo; ability to show the DVD in a classroom. Plaintiff&rsquo;s basic argument is that streaming is not included in a public performance because it can be accessed outside of a classroom, and as remotely as overseas. However, Plaintiff does not dispute that in order to access the DVDs, a person must have access to the UCLA network and specifically to the DVD. <strong>The type of access that students and/or faculty may have, whether overseas or at a coffee shop, does not take the viewing of the DVD out of the educational context.</strong> The Court finds that the licensing agreement allows Defendants to put the DVD content on the UCLA internet network as part of the provision of the agreement that Defendants could &ldquo;publicly perform&rdquo; the DVD content, and therefore Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim of copyright infringement over their right to publicly perform the DVD.</p>
<h2>(2) &ldquo;Public Display&rdquo; and &ldquo;Distribution&rdquo;</h2>
<p> <strong>Plaintiffs do not specifically counter Defendants&rsquo; arguments that &ldquo;streaming&rdquo; is not distribution or that the Complaint lacks allegations of &ldquo;public display.&rdquo;</strong> The Court finds that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for a violation of these rights under copyright law.</p>
<h2>(3) &ldquo;Copying&rdquo;</h2>
<p> Defendants do not dispute that they did not obtain authorization from AVP before placing the DVDs&rsquo; content on the UCLA network. They argue that the copying was an incidental use of their right to publicly perform the DVDs. Incidental exercises of other lawful rights constitute non-infringing &ldquo;fair use.&rdquo; See <i>perfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc.</i>, 508 F.3d 1146 (9th Cir. 2007) (holding that the creation of short-term copy to be a fair use). Here, Plaintiff AVP alleges that Defendants copied the DVD in order to be able to put it on the UCLA internet network. <strong>Because placing the DVD on the UCLA network is part of the right that Plaintiff licensed to Defendants, the copying was incidental fair use.</strong>

</blockquote>
<p>To me, this seems to equate public performance with the right to stream.  I would note that a public performance right is one that needs to be purchased/negotiated, and ownership of a physical DVD does not imply public performance rights.  (This is where I take issue with the lead paragraph of the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/10/judge-suggests-dmca-allows-dvd-ripping-if-you-own-the-dvd.ars" title="Judge suggests DMCA allows DVD ripping if you own the DVD | Ars Technica">Ars Technica article</a> covering this decision; it is not enough to have purchased the DVD -- one must purchase the public performance rights as well.)  Still, this is a significant decision for higher education institutions that seek to harmonize physical classroom capabilities/options with those of distance learners.  Or, in other words, if it can be done in the physical classroom it can be done in the virtual classroom as well (with all of the identity and enrollment access checks in place).  As the <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/judge-dismisses-lawsuit-against-ucla-over-use-of-streaming-video/33513" title="Judge Dismisses Lawsuit Against UCLA Over Use of Streaming Video | Chronicle of Higher Education Wired Campus blog">Chronicle of Higher Education</a> quotes New York Law School associate professor James Grimmelmann as saying, &ldquo;universities will have a little more breathing room for using media.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is, of course, not legal advice.  Consult your own lawyers before using this court decision as precedent.  And note that Ambrose and AIME still have the option of refiling the case subject to meeting criteria not talked about in this post.</p>
<h2>Update</h2>
<p>The original title of this post was <em>AIME v UCal Decision Says Streaming Equivalent to Public Display</em>.  It now refers to <em>Public Performance</em> rather than <em>Public Display</em>.  I was sloppy in writing the headline after constructing the post, and Jonathan's first comment indirectly pointed that out.  "Public Performance" and "Public Display" are two different rights as spelled out in the U.S. Code and are rights that are treated individually in the district judge's ruling.  Here are the definitions:</p>
<blockquote><p>To &ldquo;display&rdquo; a work means to show a copy of it, either directly or by means of a film, slide, television image, or any other device or process or, in the case of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, to show individual images nonsequentially.</p>
<p>To &ldquo;perform&rdquo; a work means to recite, render, play, dance, or act it, either directly or by means of any device or process or, in the case of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, to show its images in any sequence or to make the sounds accompanying it audible.</p>
<div style="text-align: right; width: 100%;"><cite>- U.S. Code, Title 17, Chapter 1, Section 101 ("Definitions"); paragraphs for <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#display" title="U.S. Copyright Office - Copyright Law: Chapter 1">display</a> and <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#perform" title="U.S. Copyright Office - Copyright Law: Chapter 1">perform</a></cite></div>
</blockquote>
<p>Not that these definitions really clear up anything -- there is clearly a diference between "display" and "perform" for motion picture works, but the exact distinction is not significant to me.  There are probably whole treatises written on the difference, but I couldn't come up with anything quickly that I trusted that explained the difference.  As Jonathan points out, more clarity here would be welcome.</p>
