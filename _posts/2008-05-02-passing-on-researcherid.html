    they have worked with something like OpenID?  Then publication authorship could
    be disambiguated and associated with an OpenID persona.

  content: Dunno, but something like OpenID could be used for this purpose.  The first
    question that comes to mind is whether multiple OpenIDs can be linked together.  If
    it becomes commonplace for institutions to provide OpenIDs for their students,
    faculty, and staff, then I would need a systematic way to link together the OpenID
    from my graduate school and the OpenIDs of my previous employers.  But OpenID
    would seem to solve both the identifier and authorized user issues.

<p>This morning I got an invitation to join ResearcherID, a new author profile service from Thomson Scientific.  The service sounds nice enough -- who doesn't want to take steps to avoid confusion between authors? -- and if you have access to other Thomson products (like ISI Web of Knowledge or Web of Science) it may be even nicer.  I'm all for the establishment of unique identifiers so we can start to do some interesting things with co-citation analysis and mining the web of connections in journal articles, but I'm not signing up.  At least not yet.<br />
<!--more--><br />
<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/researcher-id-email1.png"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/researcher-id-email-150x1501.png" alt="Snapshot of the E-mail Invitation to Join ReseacherID" title="ResearcherID Invitation" width="150" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-357" /></a></p>
<h2>"A Unique Identifier"</h2>
<p>The e-mail invitation starts with this:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-size:13.0pt;font-family:ArialMT;color:#926637"><b>A unique identifier</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:13.0pt;font-family:ArialMT">When you register, you are assigned a unique ID number that expressly associates you with your published works, regardless of any possible nomenclature confusion or institutional affiliation changes. These unique identifiers allow everyone who accesses ResearcherID.com to easily find a specific author&rsquo;s work, avoiding the common problem of author misidentification.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the service, I can assert that particular citations are papers that I have written.  (Interesting sidebar -- I wonder if the ResearcherID service attempts any sort of automated and/or manual verification of the claim that I was an author/co-author of a paper.)  I do this either by uploading a list of citations (in Thomson's RIS format only) or selecting them from ISI Web of Knowledge or Web of Science (if I'm at a subscribing institution).  Then I have a nicely formatted web page with all of my papers.  Granted, it isn't the only way I can go about doing this, but the Thomson service does seem to make a point about distinguishing itself by assigning me a "ResearcherID" in the process.</p>
<p>There seems to be something more going on here, though.  Why go through the effort of assigning me an alpha-numeric string and publicizing it if it isn't going to be used somewhere else?</p>
<h2>But what about the other end of the use case?</h2>
<p>The End User License Agreement (EULA) are pretty standard stuff, but buried in the middle is this:</p>
<blockquote><p>5.3.    Except as described in this Agreement, You may not use, copy, adapt, translate, modify, sell, distribute or otherwise create derivative databases, services or works of or based on the ResearcherID Service (including the Researcher Registry) or the materials accessible in the ResearcherID Service.</p></blockquote>
<p>That would seem to effectively eliminate the ResearcherID(tm) as a useful identifier in other systems.  Presumably without paying Thomson for the right to use the identifier.  And without knowing the cost of using the identifier in other systems (there doesn't seem to be any information published on ways to use the identifier elsewhere, even though an earlier section of the EULA describes such usage for "Sponsored Services"), I'm not ready to sign onto (and therefore effectively promote) such a service.</p>
<h2>The full End User License Agreement</h2>
<p>You can't get to the EULA without receiving an invitation and putting your personal information into the website.  It is only after you get the invitation and go through the first step of entering in your demographic information that you get to see the EULA.  (The "Privacy Policy" and "Terms of Use" links on the ResearchID website do not contain this information.  So, for the benefit of others in critiquing this post, I've copied the entire EULA below.</p>
<p><tt>ResearcherID Terms of Use and Privacy Policy</p>
<p>This agreement (Agreement) is a legal agreement between you, the user, (You or Your) and Thomson Scientific Inc. having its principal place of business located at 3501 Market Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104 (TS, We or Our) and describes the terms and conditions on which you may access and use and TS will provide the ResearcherID service described in Section 1 below (the ResearcherID Service), which includes the allocation to You of a unique Researcher ID (the ResearcherID).</p>
<p>BY CLICKING ON THE "ACCEPT" BUTTON BELOW YOU AGREE TO BE LEGALLY BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, TS IS UNWILLING TO PROVIDE THE RESEARCHERID SERVICE TO YOU AND YOU MUST NOT CLICK THE ACCEPT BUTTON BELOW OR CONTINUE WITH THE REGISTRATION PROCESS.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to modify this Agreement at any time by posting amended terms in the ResearcherID website at the following URL: http://www.researcherid.com (the ResearcherID Website). Your continued use of the ResearcherID Service indicates your acceptance of the amended Agreement.</p>

<p>    1.1.2.    maintain a database (the Researcher Registry) in which it will store information or metadata (such as metadata relating to the articles that You have associated with Your ResearcherID or to institutions or organisation with which you have an affiliation, whether past or present) that: (i) You provide during the registration process or subsequently update; or (ii) You provide or we collect in connection with You using Your ResearcherID (such as when you publish articles and include Your ResearcherID as an additional identifier for You) (ResearcherID Data); and</p>
<p>    1.1.3.    publish certain information and data from the Researcher Registry on the ResearcherID Website and in other Sponsored Services (defined in Section 1.2 below).</p>

TS may make interfaces to the Researcher Registry available for use in connection with products or services provided by TS, its Affiliates (such as ISI Web of Knowledge and Scholar One) or certain relevant authorised third parties (such as publishers and societies) (Sponsored Services) to:</p>
<p>    1.2.1.    enable such Sponsored Services to provide additional ResearcherID Data to the Researcher Registry, which You provide or which those Sponsored Services collect in connection with Your use of Your ResearcherID in connection with those Sponsored Services;</p>

<p>1.3.    TS will not allow any of Your personally identifiable information stored in the Researcher Registry to be published (whether on the ResearcherID Website, Sponsored Services or otherwise generally to third parties) where you have indicated a preference to restrict its publication.
