    Freakin' brilliant review. This provides a perfect path to
    duplicate this process. We are moving towards a cms and I wanted to
    wrap the opac inside of it. I didn't realize that you can do that
    with a cms. Brilliant! Thank you!

    Hi Peter -- a couple of corrections from the corporate side 1)
    WebPAC Pro is a free enhancement, not a "for cost" optional
    product. It's use is optional, but it's free if you choose to have
    us turn it on. 2) AADL makes use of an optional product called the
    XML Server. We're re-tooling this product, so it's not available
    for purchase right now, but they aren't screen-scraping HTML and
    thus this implementation is not particularly fragile. 3) For
    Millennium sites, Encore is a real-timer query of the Millennium
    database, there are no sets of data to output, etc. I believe we're
    unique in this way, so did want to correct the impression you've
    left here. Thanks much, Betsy

    Quick follow up to your post and Betsy's comment: AADL is a unique
    case. The code does indeed use III's xmlserver to resolve bib
    numbers. In addition, it does a fair amount of screen scraping
    among other things. So you are both correct. I think the thing to
    take away is that AADL is a successful proof-of-concept, but the
    software itself, as it stands now, is unlikely to be transplanted
    to another III site. John.

    Not sure if I misunderstood what you wrote about ILS replacements,
    but I think I may slightly disagree with your assessment. You note
    that Koha and Evergreen currently only offer "faceted search and
    browsing," but that they can be modified to include other features.
    You don't specify what those features are, but based on the
    remainder of your review (which is quite useful), I assume you mean
    things like the ability to pull data from external data sources and
    enhance records. Koha makes use of the Amazon API and seamlessly
    integrates the incoming data into the record display, which is
    quite nifty and something that many libraries aspire to do with
    their OPACs.

    Re #6 the_jester the patrons like the AADL site too. Frankly though
    I think a lot of this stuff is lipstick on the pig. We all need to
    start to think if the era of the "integrated library system" should
    be over and something else should take its place. When I was
    talking to my son about his (he's seven) I asked him how he looked
    things up in his elementary school library and he described that
    thing you all call an OPAC or an ILS as a "book finding system".
    Frankly, libraries need to buy and build awesome book finding
    systems. Leave the machinery of book inventory systems well hidden
    from the user...

    --\r\n\r\nI agree with your assessment.  Unstated in this text (because it is
    stated elsewhere -- another artifact of extracting just this bit from the larger
    working draft) is the importance of not stopping with these steps.  In particular,
    two of the four categories -- Web OPAC wrappers and Web OPAC replacements -- have
    the effect of isolating the front-end user interface from the back-end inventory
    control mechanisms.  With that separation in place, it is possible to make enhancements
    to the front-end that don't dramatically impact the back end (and <i>vice versa</i>).\r\n\r\nIn
    other words, it leads us along the path of a <a href=\"http://dltj.org/tag/librarysoa/\"
    title=\"&#039;Library SOA&#039; tag in DLTJ\" rel=\"nofollow\">library service-oriented
    architecture</a> that will enable us to move more nimbly in the future on both
    the front end and the back end.  The rest of the text from which this is taken
    actually goes on to talk about an \"everything finding system\" in the form of
    a 'master index' that brings all of the library's curated resources (purchased,
    licensed, vetted free, etc.) under one search interface."

<p>Schemes to add functionality to the web OPAC fall into four categories:  web OPAC enhancements, web OPAC wrappers, web OPAC replacements, and integrated library system replacements.  I'm outlining these four techniques in a report I'm editing for an OhioLINK strategic task force and a bit of a reality check on this categorization is desired, so if I'm missing anything big (conceptually or announcements of projects/products that fall into these categories), please let me know in the comments.  Generally speaking, this list is ordered by cost/complexity to implement -- from lowest to highest -- as well as the ability to offer the described enhanced services from least likely to most likely.</p>
<p><strong>Web OPAC enhancements</strong> are functions that are added to the existing web OPAC system. This most often entails additional product purchases from the automation vendor, such as the optional enhancements in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071015145500/http://iii.com/mill/webopac.shtml" title="WebPAC Pro product description">WebPAC Pro</a> for Millennium OPACs or <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071109170053/http://www.sirsidynix.com/Solutions/Products/portalsearch.php#content" title="SirsiDynix : Solutions : Portal &amp; Search Solutions">content solutions</a> in SirsiDynix.  Enhancement can also be added through creative use of an existing web OPAC's template functions, such as the method by which <a href="http://www.librarything.com/forlibraries/" title="Library Think for Libraries homepage">LibraryThing for Libraries</a> can be added to OPAC displays.</p>
<p><strong>Web OPAC wrappers</strong> use the existing web OPAC provided by the integrated library system as a source of information, but hide that information behind a completely new interface.  The intervening system get that information from the integrated library system through a variety of mechanism.  In some cases, it may be possible to use established protocols (such as Z39.50) or programming interfaces (such as an XML content server).  In cases where such functionality is not available from the underlying integrated library system, a "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=screen-scraping+HTML" title="Google search results for &#039;screen scraping HTML&#039;">screen-scraping HTML</a>" technique may be required.  ((Such a technique gets the information from the ILS using the existing web OPAC.  Such schemes are generally fragile because changes to the underlying web OPAC can have detrimental affects on the content scraping process.))</p>
<p>One example of such a wrapper is the work at Ann Arbor Public Library on SOPAC.  Short for "Social OPAC," SOPAC is "a set of social networking tools integrated into the AADL catalog [that] gives users the ability to rate, review, comment-on, and tag items." ((Blyberg, J. (2007). AADL.org Goes Social. blyberg.net. Retrieved October 12, 2007, from <a href="http://www.blyberg.net/2007/01/21/aadlorg-goes-social/" title="Blog posting announcing SOPAC">http://www.blyberg.net/2007/01/21/aadlorg-goes-social/</a>))  It uses an open source content management system called Drupal as a structure through which the added functionality is provided.  For example, when a user seeks the bibliographic information page for a catalog record, that request is made from the user's browser to the Drupal software.  The Drupal software in turn makes a request to the integrated library system for the bibliographic information it holds.  The response from the ILS is parsed by the Drupal software for key information such as title, author, subjects, holdings, etc.  This information is mixed with information stored in the Drupal database (ratings, tags, reviews, cover images, etc.) and a new web page is created and returned to the user's browser.</p>
<p>Another example of a web OPAC wrapper is <a href="http://about.scriblio.net/" title="Scriblio about page">Scriblio</a> (formerly called WPopac).  Using the underlying framework of Wordpress, Scriblio offers faceted browsing, tagging, and syndication feeds for the underlying Millennium WebOPAC.  Scriblio is a project of Plymouth State University, supported in part by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.  Both SOPAC and Scriblio are available under open source licenses.</p>
<p><strong>Web OPAC replacements</strong> are new systems that completely replace the existing web OPAC.  Unlike wrappers (which get their bibliographic data in real-time from the underlying web OPAC), these replacements operate on sets of records that are extracted from the ILS or come from another source.  (In some cases, these replacements still rely on the underlying web OPAC as a source of item status information such as checked out status and due date.) The first notable OPAC replacement was at <a href="http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/endeca/" title="About Endeca at NCSU Libraries">North Carolina State University when its library installed and configured</a> the <a href="http://endeca.com/" title="Endeca corporate homepage">Endeca software</a> to provide <a href="http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/catalog/" title="NCSU Libraries Online Catalog">a faceted browse to the library catalog</a>.  By itself, an Endeca OPAC display does not enable tagging, annotation, or user aggregation services such as recommendation engines.&#160; Other similar web OPAC replacements are <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080328163000/http://www.iii.com/encore/main_index2.html" title="Encore product information page">Encore from Innovative Interfaces</a> ((As Betsy Graham, Vice President of Product Management at Innovative Interfaces, notes in the comments, the Encore will perform real-time queries to a Millennium ILS for bibliographic data, and in such cases the data extract is not needed.)), <a href="http://www.exlibrisgroup.com/primo.htm" title="Primo product information page">Primo from Ex Libris</a> and <a href="http://www.medialab.nl/" title="Aquabrowser product information page">Aquabrowser from Medialab Solutions</a>.  Miami University's experiments with the open source Apache SOLR and the exported records from their Millennium system also fall into this category.  Worldcat Local is also a form of web OPAC replacement noting that the source of bibliographic records is the OCLC Worldcat database rather than the local ILS.</p>
<p><strong>ILS replacements</strong> offer the biggest opportunity for enhanced user services, particularly by adopting one of the open source solutions now available. At this time, neither of the open source solutions (<a href="http://open-ils.org/" title="Evergreen homepage">Evergreen</a> and <a href="http://www.koha.org/" title="Koha homepage">Koha</a>) offers more than faceted search and browsing. Unlike the commercial systems, however, the source code of the system can be modified to add these functions, and the modifications shared with other users of the same system.</p>
