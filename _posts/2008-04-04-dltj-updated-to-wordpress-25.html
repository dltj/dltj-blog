<p>Unlike previous upgrades, this left some functionality broken -- notably some of the links in the second block under the "about" heading to the left (if you are reading this from <a href="/">http://dltj.org/</a> itself).  But, you know what? -- it's Friday afternoon and all of the important bits are working.  I think.  So if you see anything odd, please let me know.<br />
