  content: "[...] Following up on Art&#8217;s ideas on the backend was Peter Murray&#8217;s
    talk on SOA in libraries. I&#8217;ve read on SOA but haven&#8217;t really kept
    up as I should. His main focus, that at least I picked up on, was the componentization
    of the ILS. Having discrete software that is specialized and have open protocols
    or paths for them to talk to each other. It fits well with the ideas Art has on
    using outside software and I also think such an architecture may be needed to
    allow rapid changes in workflow or collections, like the rise in ERM. There seems
    to be some work around NCIP and other ideas with some of the opensource ILS&#8217;s
    that may help support such an architecture in libraries. I won&#8217;t try to
    explain much else, browse pmurray&#8217;s blog if you want more info. There may
    be better or alternative models, i&#8217;m not sure. [...]"
