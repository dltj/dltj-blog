  content: Hey, Aaron -- I had to go back and look to see when this dream was published.
    (It was August 2006 -- eons ago in Internet time.)  And you're right...we probably
    do have enough information now to pull this off.  I haven't seen anyone come up
    with one of these tools, but it would make a nice project.

  content: "Peter, yes hope you don't mind me commenting so much later.\r\n\r\n2006
    is eons ago, back then I wasn't even in the library field yet.\r\n\r\nI am slowly
    learning library technology relating to searching. opacs, link resolvers and your
    blog is really useful to later comers like me to see what the debates were before
    \"my time\"..\r\n\r\n I am in fact trying to write a long blog post on the different
    methods of finding known articles e.g citation linker, browse by journal in opac
    or a-z journal listings, article level approaches by directly enetring article
    titles in gogole scholar, summon etc...  \r\n\r\nSome are more \"accurate\" then
    others but the less perfect method might be a lot quicker. \r\n\r\nIf say searching
    google scholar then linking via google scholar program gets you there say 90%
    of the time and takes 30 seconds each time,  while 10% of the time you need to
    do the more  correct journal browse via OPAC that takes 10 minutes.... It beats
    doing 100% of the time  the journal browse first....\r\n\r\nDoes this make sense?"

    Hey, Aaron!  I'd love to see your blog post when you are done.

    I must admit to being a bit of a perfectionist -- and I think a lot of librarians fall into that category -- so the 10% is the killer.  Long ago (e.g. two, maybe three years ago) there were attempts to gauge the coverage of Google Scholar and the results were very mixed.  Google isn't publishing information, so you have to try to find coverage information by inference.  One would also want to include Microsoft's Academic Search in any such review now, too -- it has come a long way and has even surpassed Google Scholar by some measures.

<p>When it comes to seeking a full-text copy of that known-item citation, are our users asking "what have you done for me lately?"  OpenURL has taken us pretty far when one starts in an online environment -- a link that sends the citation elements to our favorite link resolver -- but it only works when the user starts online with an OpenURL-enabled database.  (We also need to set aside for the moment the need for some sort of OpenURL base resolver URL discovery tool -- how does an arbitrary service know <em>which</em> OpenURL base resolver I want to use!)  What if a user has a citation on a printed paper or from some other non-online form?  Could we make their lives easier, too?  Here is one way.  (Thanks go out to Celeste Feather and Thomas Dowling for helping me think through the possibilities and issues.)</p>
<p>Some sites have addressed this issue with a static HTML form that prompts for the citation information (for example, this sample from <span class="removed_link" title="http://demo.exlibrisgroup.com:9003/demo/cgi/core/citation-linker.cgi">Ex Libris' SFX demo server</span>).  That is so Web-1.0, though -- you have to fill out the entire form before you get any response back from the server on the availability (or non-availability) of the article you are trying to find.  What if we could meet the user where they are with an interactive dialog that would quickly connect the user with the article?</p>
<p>One of the underlying assumptions is that users are still going to the OPAC to do a known-item search by journal title to see if the journal is held by the library in some form.  The scheme that follows, though, would work just as well in A-Z journal lists and other places where the ISSN of the desired journal is known.  The process starts when the user clicks on a link encoded with the ISSN from the bibliographic record pointing into our new OpenURL link resolver.  The link resolver returns to the browser a page that lists articles from the given ISSN in reverse chronological order.  (The theory here is, of course, to give the user some results, even though they are not likely what the user wants!)</p>
<p>The page also has an HTML form with fields for citation elements.  As the user keys information into the form fields, AJAX calls update the results area of the web page with relevant hits.  For instance, if a user types the first few letters of the author's last name, the results area of the web page shows articles by that author in the journal.  (We could also help the user with form-field completion based on name authority records and other author tables so that even as the user types the first few letters of the last name he or she could then pick the full name out of a list.)  With luck, the user might find the desired article without any additional data entry!</p>
<p>Another path into the citation results via the link resolver:  if a user types the volume into the form field, the AJAX calls cause links to appear to issues of that volume in addition to updating the results to a reverse chronological listing of articles.  If a user then types the issue into the HTML form field or clicks the issue link, the results area displays articles from that issue in page number order.  Selecting the link of an article would show the list of sources where the article can be found (as our OpenURL resolvers do now), and off the user goes.</p>
<p>Ideally, all of the form elements would be AJAX'd, so if a user types an author's last name and a year, the appropriate citation(s) would show up.  One might even be able to insert this activity in an IFRAME right on the bibliographic record display (if one have that much control over HTML layouts of various systems).</p>
<p>So what is to prevent us from reaching this citation discovery nirvana now?  Well, a couple of things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Our link resolvers don't know anything about the actual citations of items in journals -- they just know how to take the citation elements and construct a URL that points into some other system.  In order to make this work, our link resolver would need to be paired with a metasearch engine or a comprehensive index of article citations (or both).</li>
<li>It would be helpful if there was an ISSN disambiguator to find alternate ISSNs (print vs. electronic, etc.) in order to cast a wide net for possible results.  (In other words,  a counterpart to <a href="http://xisbn.worldcat.org/xisbnadmin/doc/api.htm" title="xISBN [OCLC - Projects]">OCLC's xISBN resolver service</a>.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Two pretty high hurdles.  Still, it would be really useful if we could pull it off, wouldn't it?</p>
