<p>I'm sitting in the Denver airport (and quite pleased to have remembered my note to myself about <a href="/article/ssh-as-socks-proxy/">tunneling through ad-laden interception proxy</a>) with lots to think and blog about after this year's Midwinter meeting.  It was a <em>very</em> productive meeting, but I am still in "travel mode" so I thought I'd mention a new service called <a href="http://www.tripit.com/" title="TripIt homepage">TripIt</a> that has made this travel notably easier.</p>
<p>TripIt is "a personal travel assistant that automatically organizes all your travel plans."  Getting started is easy: one just forwards confirmation e-mails from flights, lodging, airport shuttles, rental cars and the like to "plans@tripit.com" and the software starts adding all of this information into a consolidated itinerary.  The software offers destination information such as maps and directions.  The itinerary includes links to online check-in services and flight information.  And you can do all of this without creating an account.  If you do create an account, you can build a network of fellow travelers to see when you might be in the same location at the same time.  (If I were to travel much, I can see where this would be a very handy "social networking" feature.)</p>
<p>For instance, you can see a <a href="http://www.tripit.com/trip/public/id/E4234B78C43D963DF48A5837A9799379" title="Sample itinerary">public view of my recent itinerary</a> for the OLE Project and ALA Midwinter trip.  (TripIt didn't understand the ALA travel service confirmation e-mails for the lodging arrangements, so I had to enter that by hand.)  This view is missing my confirmation numbers and other private details, but it is a useful view to share with spouses and office managers.  If you join TripIt and want to connect networks, let me know.</p>
