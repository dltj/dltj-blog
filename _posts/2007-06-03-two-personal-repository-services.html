  content: "[from one of the publicationslist.org developers]\r\nAn interesting comparison
    - I like the observation that the main problem is to motivate researchers to put
    their publications online. With publicationslist.org we thought that people would
    be more motivated to make their own online publications list look good than to
    submit to an institutional / central repository - perhaps the answer is a combination
    of the two. \r\n \r\n<a href=\"http://publicationslist.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">publicationslist.org</a>
    does include a bibliographic export feature - e.g. click on an article title or
    one of the grey triangles in <a href=\"http://publicationslist.org/rcc\" rel=\"nofollow\">this
    sample list</a> and you should see the abstract as well as the export links (to
    bibtex / endnote / RIS etc).\r\nIt's also possible to select &amp; export multiple
    articles in these formats from the edit page of your own publications list."

  content: "Hello, Fred -- thanks for posting a comment.  You are a bit lucky in the
    U.K. since researchers in that country are motivated by the <a href=\"http://www.rae.ac.uk/\"
    title=\"U.K. Research Assessment Exercise homepage\" rel=\"nofollow\">Research
    Assessment Exercise</a> to make their works widely accessible.  (The Australians
    share the same motivating factor.)  As the Cornell paper outlines, in the U.S.
    the motivation tends to come more from recognition within the discipline rather
    than with the institution.  Thus we have seen the growth of discipline-specific
    archives.  Academic researchers here tend to have a need to fill out \"faculty
    activity reports\" of which the publications list is just one part.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the clarification about exporting citations -- I missed that in my review."

<p>This year has seen the release of two personal repository services:  <a href="http://publicationslist.org/" title="Homepage: PublicationsList.org">http://PublicationsList.org/</a> and the <a href="http://edina.ac.uk/projects/depot_summary.html" title="Homepage: The Depot">U.K. Depot</a>.  These two services have an admittedly different focus, but I think it is still interesting to compare and contrast them to see what we can learn.<br />
<!--more--></p>
<h2>The Depot</h2>
<p><i>The Depot</i> provides one-stop place for U.K.-based researchers to deposit refereed articles, book chapters, and conference papers.  It is "one-stop" in that The Depot can forward the author to his/her institution-based repository <em>or</em>, in the case where the author's institution does not have a repository, upload and host the content right from The Depot.</p>
<p>The deposit interface, for those putting content directly into the centralized Depot repository, has four main stages.  First, the "Type" stage, specifying whether the object is an article, a book chapter, or a conference paper: <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/depot-01-type.png" alt="The Depot - &ldquo;Type&rdquo; Screen" /></p>
<p>Next, the "Upload" stage, where one can upload the file and supply a few more properties: <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/depot-02-upload.png" alt="The Depot - &ldquo;Upload&rdquo; Screen" /></p>
<p>Then the "Details" stage, where the descriptive metadata (minus the controlled vocabulary subjects -- that comes in the next screen) is input: <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/depot-03-details.png" alt="The Depot - &ldquo;Details&rdquo; Screen" /></p>
<p>And finally, the "Subjects" page, with an AJAX-driven expanding-and-collapsing hierarchy of subjects:<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/depot-04-subjects.png" alt="The Depot - &ldquo;Subjects&rdquo; Screen" /></p>
<p>To retrieve contents from the repository, there is a "<span class="removed_link" title="http://deposit.depot.edina.ac.uk/view/">browse</span>" interface for looking by 'year' or by 'subject' -- no other browse facets and no search interface.  The Depot was just formally released this month, so I would bet that functionality like that is in the works.</p>
<h2>PublicationsList.org</h2>
<p><a href="http://publicationslist.org/" title="Homepage: PublicationsList">PublicationsList</a> is a commercial service with a free, limited-functionality version.  Unlike The Depot (and similar institutional repository systems), the focus is on putting together and publishing a personal bibliography with the deposit function taking a secondary role (and only for paid subscribers of the service).  </p>
<p>The single item entry page is a just-the-facts interface.  Note that the content hosting service is only available to those who have upgraded to the "Publications List Professional" version (which <a href="http://publicationslist.org/faq.html" title="Publications List FAQ">costs</a> &pound;9.99, or approx $20/&euro;15, per year).<br />
<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/single-item-reference-entry.png" alt="PublicationList single item entry" /></p>
<p>The system can also accept a variety of citation manager file formats for bulk entry. (See snapshot to the right.) <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/import-references.png" alt="PublicationsList Import" style="float: right;" />  PublicationsList also has a built in <a href="http://publicationslist.org/pubmed.html" title="PubMed - keep your online publications list up to date with import from NLM / NIH PubMed / MEDLINE">search-and-select interface to PubMed</a> for finding publications matching your name and automatically populating the metadata fields in your personal citation.</p>
<p>Then end result is a web-based bibliography with links to the publications (either hosted on PublicationsList or on other sites).  The free version is hosted on PublicationsList.org (see the <a href="http://publicationslist.org/rcc" title="rcc - Publications List">service founder's </a>page as an example) and the professional version can <a href="http://publicationslist.org/embed.html" title="Embedding a publications list in another web page">embed the publications list in your own page</a>.  </p>
<p>PublicationsList does provide discounts and additional functionality for <a href="http://publicationslist.org/group.html" title="Register a group publications list">groups</a> (such as departments, research centers, etc.).<br />
<br clear="all" /></p>
<h2>Observations</h2>
<p>Both The Depot and PublicationsList provide interesting suites of features for academics seeking to get their content online, but neither really addresses the problems of getting academics to put their content online.  ((For a really good discussion of that problem, see Davis, P.M., & Connolly, M.J.L. (2007). Institutional Repositories: Evaluating the Reasons for Non-use of Cornell University's Installation of DSpace. <i>D-Lib Magazine</i>, 13(3/4). Retrieved March 14, 2007, from <a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/march07/davis/03davis.html" title="Article: Institutional Repositories: Evaluating the Reasons for Non-use of Cornell University&#039;s Installation of DSpace">http://www.dlib.org/dlib/march07/davis/03davis.html</a>.))  The search-and-select interface for PubMed is very helpful in cutting down on the data entry required to populate a citation entry.  If OhioLINK were to replicate this service, we could tap into not only PubMed but also the wide variety of index/abstract databases and electronic journals that we host.  The automatic handling of various forms of citation management data is also nice.  I don't think PublicationsList offers an <em>export</em> feature, which would be good to have so that an author can add entries found through the search-and-select interface back into their personal bibliographic management software.</p>
<p>The one-stop, redirection service in The Depot is a good concept, too.  <em>If</em> a researcher wanted to deposit their content in a repository and they weren't sure if their institution had a repository to hold it, OhioLINK would be a natural place to look for a content hosting service in the state and we could redirect the author to the appropriate location on a campus.  OhioLINK could also be playing the role of repository-of-last-resort for Ohio academic researchers by providing a space and services for published content, whether or not the institution in question has set up a formal repository space on the DRC.
