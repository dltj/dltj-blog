<p>The American Library Association annual conference is getting more social each year, and as a long-time member of ALA and often a critic of the, well, un-togetherness of ALA's electronic capabilities, it is nice to see the trend continuing this year.  Take, for instance, the <a href="http://wikis.ala.org/annual2008/index.php/Blogging_Annual" title="Blogging ALA Annual 2008">Blogger's Room</a>.  Initially just a LITA thing, it is now being promoted as an association-wide service.  As I write this, that page has about two dozen entries for individual and group blogs that say they will be covering conference events.</p>
<p>Or take <a href="http://twitter.com/brianeisley" title="Twitter / brianeisley">Brian Eisley</a>'s unofficial <a href="http://twitter.com/ala2008" title="Twitter / ala2008">Twitter reflector</a>.  (Brian calls it a group; I'm calling it a reflector; it is something different than a <a href="http://twitter.pbwiki.com/Hashtags" title="About Twitter Hashtags">Twitter Hashtag</a>.)  He has <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.brianeisley.com/TwitterALA2008/">put up some instructions</span> on how to get signed up to receive and how to sent messages to the reflector.  There is also the <span class="removed_link" title="http://twemes.com/ala08">Twitter hashtag #ala08</span>.  I'm a Twitter <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newbie#Newb" title="Newbie - Wikipedia">newb</a>, so I don't know the differences, advantages, and disadvantages of each.  But I'm interested to learn...</p>
<p>Speaking of tags, the <a href="http://wikis.ala.org/annual2008/index.php/Main_Page#Sharing" title="Sharing anchor on ALA Annual 2008 Wiki homepage">ALA Annual Wiki</a> defines <strong>ala2008</strong> as the official conference tag.  That's not such a stretch to assume -- it is a logical choice -- but the establishment of an "official tag" (as much as anything is official in the social tagging space) does help collocate meeting content in the <span class="removed_link" title="http://technorati.com/search/ala2008">blogosphere</span>, in <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/ala2008/" title="Flickr: "ala2008"">Flickr</a>, and in <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/ala2008" title="Pages tagged with &amp;quot;ala2008&amp;quot; on del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>.  (What?!? ...you say?  That's the function of subject analysis and description?  Here in the unwashed folksonomy space?  Blasphemy!)</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/annual-wiki-isolation.jpg" alt="" title="Visual isolation of the "Annual Wiki" link in the conference site navigation bar" width="264" height="194" class="alignright size-full wp-image-380" style="padding: 0 0 1.5em 2em;" /> Did I mention the <a href="http://wikis.ala.org/annual2008/index.php/Main_Page" title="ALA Annual 2008 Wiki homepage">Official ALA Annual Wiki</a>?  It is now getting prominent placement in the navigation area of the <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.ala.org/ala/eventsandconferencesb/annual/2008a/home.cfm">primary conference pages</span>.  The fifth link down -- pretty impressive.  And it is easy to see why.  The <a href="http://wikis.ala.org/annual2008/index.php/Main_Page" title="ALA Annual 2008 Wiki homepage">Official Wiki</a> holds a host of information not previously found in the American Libraries insert or even on-site.  Links to policies and procedures, a <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?hl=en&#038;gl=us&#038;ptab=2&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;oe=UTF8&#038;msa=0&#038;msid=100234958050911716886.00044f53fd00f35e0d198&#038;ll=33.806716,-117.916045&#038;spn=0.008701,0.018711&#038;z=16" title="Anaheim Convention Center area restaurants and hotels">Google map of area restaurants and hotels</a>, an "<a href="http://wikis.ala.org/annual2008/index.php/Unofficial_Events" title="Unofficial Events at ALA Annual 2008">Unofficial Events</a>" page, and a <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.presentations.ala.org/index.php?title=Main_Page#2008_Annual_Conference">Conference Presentation Materials site</span> to put all of the PowerPoints and handouts from meetings.</p>
<p>It is nice to see ALA providing this space where grassroots organization and promotional efforts can be shepherded in on co-located space.  There was a time that this was spread out over various hand-coded web pages, blogs and other web services.  Way to go, ALA; and way to go ALA members!</p>
