When I converted this blog from WordPress to a static site generated with {% include robustlink.html href="https://jekyllrb.com/" versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20210709084250/https://jekyllrb.com/" versiondate="2021-07-09" title="Jekyll project homepage" anchor="Jekyll" %} in 2018, I lost the ability for readers to make comments. 
At the time, I thought that one day I would set up an installation of {% include robustlink.html href="https://discourse.org/" versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20210711050322/https://www.discourse.org/" versiondate="2021-07-11" title="Discourse software homepage" anchor="Discourse" %} for comments like {% include robustlink.html href="https://blog.discourse.org/2013/08/our-second-partner-boing-boing/" versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20210711211533/https://blog.discourse.org/2013/08/our-second-partner-boing-boing/" versiondate="2021-07-11" title="Our Second Partner: Boing Boing | Discourse" anchor="Boing Boing did in 2013" %}. 
But I never found the time to do that. 
Alternatively, I could do what NPR has done—{% include robustlink.html href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thisisnpr/2016/08/16/490208179/beyond-comments-finding-better-ways-to-connect-with-you" versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20210711212114/https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2016/08/17/490208179/beyond-comments-finding-better-ways-to-connect-with-you" versiondate="2021-07-11" title="Beyond Comments: Finding Better Ways To Connect With You | NPR Extra" anchor="abandon comments on its site in favor of encouraging people to use Twitter and Facebook" %}—but that means blog readers don't see where the conversation is happening. 
This article talks about {% include robustlink.html href="https://indieweb.org/" versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20210702052425/https://indieweb.org/" versiondate="2021-07-11" title="IndieWeb project homepage" anchor="IndieWeb" %}—a blog-to-blog communication method—and the pieces needed to make it work on both a static website and for social-media-to-blog commentary.
 
The IndieWeb is a combination of {% include robustlink.html href="https://indiewebify.me/" versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20210711213601/https://indiewebify.me/" versiondate="2021-07-11" title="IndieWebify.Me: A guide to getting you on the IndieWeb" anchor="HTML markup" %} and an {% include robustlink.html href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/" versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20210711010105/https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/" versiondate="2021-07-11" title="Webmention, a W3C Recommendation" anchor="HTTP protocol" %} for capturing discussions between blogs. 
To participate in the IndieWeb ecosystem, a blog needs to support the "{% include robustlink.html href="https://microformats.org/wiki/h-card" versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20210707082159/https://microformats.org/wiki/h-card" versiondate="2021-07-11" title="h-card specification" anchor="h-card" %}" and "{% include robustlink.html href="https://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry" versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20210712015751/https://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry" versiondate="2021-07-11" title="h-entry specification" anchor="h-entry" %}" microformats. 
These microformats are ways to add HTML markup to a site to be read and recognized by machines. 
If you follow the {% include robustlink.html href="https://indiewebify.me/" versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20210711213601/https://indiewebify.me/" versiondate="2021-07-11" title="IndieWebify.Me: A guide to getting you on the IndieWeb" anchor="instructions at IndieWebify.me" %}, the "Level 2" steps will check your site's webpages for the appropriate markup. 
The Jekyll theme I use here, {% include robustlink.html href="https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/" versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20210712015848/https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/" versiondate="2021-07-11" title="minimal-mistakes theme on GitHub" anchor="minimal-mistakes" %}, didn't include the microformat markup, so I {% include robustlink.html href="https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/pull/3052" versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20210712020009/https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/pull/3052" versiondate="2021-07-11" title="Pull request 3052 adding microformats to minimal-mistakes" anchor="made a pull request" %} to add it. 

With the markup in place, dltj.org uses the {% include robustlink.html href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/" versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20210711010105/https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/" versiondate="2021-07-11" title="Webmention, a W3C Recommendation" anchor="Webmention protocol" %} to notify others when I link to their content and receive notifications from others.
If you're setting this up for yourself, hopefully someone has already {% include robustlink.html href="https://indieweb.org/Webmention#Publishing_Software" versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20210712025223/https://indieweb.org/Webmention#Publishing_Software" versiondate="2021-07-11" title="Publishing software link on IndieWeb's Webmentions wiki page" anchor="gone through the effort" %} of adding the necessary Webmention communication bits to your blog software. 
Since <i><acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester">DLTJ</acronym></i> is a static website, I'm using the {% include robustlink.html href="https://webmention.io/" versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20210707082122/https://webmention.io/" versiondate="2021-07-11" title="webmention.io homepage" anchor="Webmention.IO service" %} to send and receive Webmention information on behalf of dltj.org and a Jekyll plugin called {% include robustlink.html href="https://github.com/aarongustafson/jekyll-webmention_io/" versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20210712020229/https://github.com/aarongustafson/jekyll-webmention_io/" versiondate="2021-07-11" title="Jekyll-webmention_io project homepage" anchor="jekyll-webmention_io" %} to integrate Webmention data into my blog's content. 
The plugin gets that data from webmention.io, caches it locally, and builds into each article the list of webmentions and {% include robustlink.html href="https://www.hixie.ch/specs/pingback/pingback" versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20210712015504/https://www.hixie.ch/specs/pingback/pingback" versiondate="2021-07-11" title="Pingback 1.0 specification" anchor="pingbacks" %} (another kind of blog-to-blog communication protocol) received. 

Webmention.IO and jekyll-webmention_io will capture some commentary. 
To get comments from Twitter, Mastodon, Facebook, and elsewhere, I added the Bridgy service to the mix. 
From their {% include robustlink.html href="https://brid.gy/about#how" versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20210712014738/https://brid.gy/about#how" versiondate="2021-07-11" title="Bridgy service's 'about' page" anchor="About page" %} : "Bridgy periodically checks social networks for responses to your posts and links to your web site and sends them back to your site as webmentions." 
So all of that commentary gets fed back into the blog post as well.

I've just started using this Webmention/Bridgy setup, so I may have some pieces misconfigured. 
I'll be watching over the next several blog posts to make sure everything is working. 
If you notice something that isn't working, please reach out to me via one of the mechanisms listed in the sidebar of this site.
