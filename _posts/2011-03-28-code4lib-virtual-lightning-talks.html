<p>One of the highlights of the <a href="http://www.code4lib.org/" title="code4lib | coders for libraries, libraries for coders">Code4Lib</a> <a href="http://www.code4lib.org/conference" title="Code4Lib conference | code4lib">annual meeting</a> is the &ldquo;lightning talk&rdquo; rounds. A lightning talk is a fast-paced 5 minute talk on a topic of the presenter&rsquo;s choosing. They are usually scheduled on an ad-hoc, first-come-first-served basis on the day of the event. They are an opportunity to provide a platform for someone who is just getting started with public speaking, who wants to ask a question or invite people to help with a project, or for someone to boast about something he or she did or tell a short cautionary story. These things are all interesting and worth talking about, but there might not be enough to say about them to fill up a full session timeslot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Virtual Lightning Talks&rdquo; replicates this conference activity online in a virtual meeting environment. Each one-hour block consists of 10 six-minute sessions (one minute for the presenter to take control of the virtual meeting environment and test audio followed by a five minute presentation). Presenters show their work by sharing their entire desktop; the presentation can consist of slides, web browser, command-line shell, or any other application that can be shown on the desktop.</p>
<p>The first round will be on <a href="http://timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?month=4&day=4&year=2011&hour=13&min=30&sec=0&p1=179" title="http://timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?month=4&day=4&year=2011&hour=13&min=30&sec=0&p1=179">April 4th at 1:30pm Eastern U.S. Daylight Time</a>.  The <a href="http://wiki.code4lib.org/index.php/Virtual_Lightning_Talks" title="Virtual Lightning Talks - Code4Lib">Virtual Lightning Talks page on the Code4Lib wiki</a> has more information and space to sign up to be a presenter or attendee.</p>
