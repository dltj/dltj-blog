<p>Activity still continues on the <a href="http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/" title="Digital Preservation (Library of Congress)">National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program</a> (NDIIP).  There were two stories in Washington DC newspapers in recent weeks.  The more interesting of the two came from the May 16th Washington Post in a column by Jim Barksdale and Francine Berman called <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/15/AR2007051501873.html?hpid=opinionsbox1" title="Jim Barksdale and Francine Berman - Saving Our Digital Heritage - washingtonpost.com">Saving our Digital Heritage</a>.  Barksdale &mdash; of Netscape Corp. fame and now a member of the NDIIP advisory council &mdash; and Berman make a brief but impassioned plea for restoring the <a href="/article/ndiipp-funding/">NDIIP funding that was rescinded earlier this year</a>.  (<a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/metro/20070425-105139-2450r_page2.htm" title="Saving the digital record&nbsp;-&nbsp;Metropolitan&nbsp;-&nbsp;The Washington Times, America&#39;s Newspaper">The other article, in the Washington Times</a>, ("Saving the digital record", 25-Apr-2007, article no longer available online) oddly praises the program but makes no mention of the funding rescission.)  And I heard today from an "Unnamed Washington Source" that the leadership at the Library of Congress will seek to have some, if not all, of the funding restored as part of a future continuing resolution.  (Hopefully one that won't <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-h1591/show" title="">get vetoed</a>.)</p>
<p>At the same time, the Library of Congress is <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/news/news0407.html">planning several NDIIP-related programs at the American Library Association annual meeting</span> next month.  One hopes that all of this buzz will encourage Congress to restore funding support for the program.</p>
<p>Update (20070525T2015): It would appear that the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:H.R.2206:" title="Search Results - THOMAS (Library of Congress)">bill passed by both houses of Congress (version #6)</a> did not include language to put back funding for NDIIIP.  Or, at least I don't see mention of it -- it is a big bill.</p>
<p>Update (200804042140): Removed the link to the Washington Times article -- it is no longer available online.
