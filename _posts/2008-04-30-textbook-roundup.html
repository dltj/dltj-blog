  content: "Jester, you said:\r\n\r\n\"...this is the first time I&rsquo;ve heard
    that &ldquo;students are paying higher prices to make life easier for their professors.&rdquo;
    I&rsquo;m not necessarily buying that.\"\r\n\r\nWell, you can buy it or not, but
    if you really dig down into this topic--and I mean really get into it--you'll
    see that it's true.  Scratch below the surface a bit,  and you will discover that
    the proliferation of \"ancillary\" materials--all the multimedia resources, testing
    and assessment programs, transparencies, instructor's manuals, Blackboard cartridges,
    custom teaching plans, \"syllabi conversions,\" lab manuals, test-banks, solutions
    manuals, author fly-ins for training seminars, free video offers, 'professional
    development grants' (i.e., kickbacks), etc., etc., etc.--is one of the most important
    reasons that textbooks have become so expensive.  \r\n\r\nAncillary programs,
    especially in the 'hard' sciences, often run into the very high hundreds of thousands
    of dollars to develop.  Add to this the explosion of complex art programs (again,
    most noticeable in the sciences), insane advances paid to some authors, and the
    ever-increasing costs involved in the design, typesetting and manufacture of the
    actual texts, and the result is that a new text in a field can end up costing
    a publisher two or three million bucks before the first copy leaves the warehouse.
    \r\n\r\n(Now add to these external costs the salaries of the people working hard
    for the publisher--and yes, by god, these people work hard and are not paid impressive
    salaries--to edit, market, and sell these books, and divide all those costs by
    the rather-unimpressive number of copies that even the most wildly-successful
    college text sells, and you will finally see why textbooks cost what they do these
    days, and incidentally, what a crappy way to make money this whole business of
    publishing textbooks is.)\r\n\r\nAll right then, so who's to blame?  Who, exactly,
    has called for this explosion of pedagogical support, both in the book and around
    it?  Overworked and underfunded faculty, naturally. Not that I blame these folks
    for demanding more from publishers.  After all, their only real power, in this
    age of administrative cost-cutting, is represented by the fact that they can band
    together and choose a single text--whichever one is best supported by goodies
    that make their teaching lives less onerous--for every section of their over-enrolled,
    under-funded course.  Interestingly enough, faculty members on campuses that are,
    for lack of a better term, lower-prestige institutions are often the ones for
    whom textbook publishers are creating and marketing all this stuff.  Ask anyone
    in the industry, and they'll tell you just how powerful and 'important' the faculty
    at UNLV or Blinn College (TX) have become, precisely because they have been burdened
    with supersized survey courses.  They've definitely taken the lemons doled out
    to them by their administrations and made some pretty yummy lemonade out of it----forcing
    publishers to jump through lots of hoops and provide them with most of the material
    and ideas needed to teach the course effectively, and even getting the publishers
    to route some cash their way to pay for photocopying and other essential department
    functions.\r\n\r\nThis really is a fairly straightforward cause-and-effect chain
    of events:  Administrators, keen on cutting costs, offer less and less in the
    way of teaching support, but they simultaneously push faculty to teach more (and
    larger) sections than ever before.  Faculty, overwhelmed by the enrollments and
    the lack of administrative support, find that they have no energy or interest
    in constructing their own teaching plans, lecture outlines, multimedia assets,
    quizzes or tests, and therefore push publishers to provide them with ready-made
    versions of these things.  Publishers (despite the grumblings about 'monopolistic'
    behaviors among uninformed critics of the industry) compete against each other
    to produce ever more elaborate and 'helpful' ancillaries, art programs, etc.,
    thus engaging in a counter-productive arms-race.  Is it any surprise that the
    direct result of this chain is a precipitous increase in the cost of developing
    a new textbook, and, finally, higher prices from publishers?\r\n\r\nYes, there
    are other factors at play, but this very subtle shift of responsibility for creating
    teaching materials away from colleges (and their faculty members) and onto publishers'
    shoulders is one of the top three or four factors that have increased the price
    of textbooks for students over the last decade or so.\r\n\r\nAnd by the way, the
    Colorado CC decision that you report on elsewhere is just a further step down
    this road.  Kinda funny that some of the initial reporting on that decision has
    made it sound like a good thing for students."

  content: "Wow, Peter, that is quite a lot to digest there.  You didn't give your
    full name or affiliation, but I gather that you are among the faculty community
    in this conversation -- perhaps one among the lower-prestige institutions you
    described.\r\n\r\nPlease pardon me for taking your comments with a grain of salt;
    they don't yet reconcile well with my own experiences and observations.  You present
    a compelling argument for the rise in the cost of textbooks being fueled by demands
    on publishers by faculty overworked in new excesses of teaching loads imposed
    by administrators.  Along each link in the chain of the argument, I find that
    I'm less certain about the likelihood of the positions you lay out.  I appreciate
    your perspective, though, and will add it to the list of things I'm looking out
    for in this continuing exploration."

  content: "No.  I think Peter is a publisher he sounds like a marketing manager for
    a large publishing company.\r\n\r\nWhat he says is essentially correct, professor's
    whine about expensive books, but they will not choose the \"Yugo\" of textbooks,
    they want the \"Ferrari\".  They want the bells and whistles.  There are plenty
    of low cost versions of textbooks that are rarely looked at by faculty.\r\n\r\nBut,
    a successful book that goes into new editions will turn a reasonable profit eventually,
    some of them will become cash cows that pay for the rest and get published long
    after the author has retired.  Also, sales in a foreign market will add to profitability.
    \ So, don't feel sorry for the publisher.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the rise in the cost
    of textbooks is because publishers are for profit companies and their market is
    erroding.  The big joke is that all the student PIRG groups and faculty members
    seem to think publishers should behave like they are not for profits...and that's
    just not going to happen."

  content: "Bookstore Guy has me partly pegged.  I'm an editor for a mid-sized publishing
    company that is almost never mentioned in the various articles and blogs about
    college textbooks.  My company consistently offers lower-cost options in the disciplines
    in which we publish, and we're doing just fine, but it is pretty striking how
    often the very big \"unit\" adoptions (the UNLV, Blinn, and other schools where
    the survey courses have 500+ students using the same book) go to the expensive
    books.\r\n\r\nAnd believe me, I have very little sympathy for my much larger conglomerate
    competitors.  Nonetheless, I can't help but become exasperated as I read article
    after article (and blog after blog) on the topic of textbook pricing without seeing
    any evidence of this very important sub-topic.  It is absolutely fundamental,
    and nearly invisible."

  content: "Thanks, Peter, for giving a little bit more of your background.  It helps
    to know where your coming from.  As I said in my original post, the nature of
    faculty choice being driven by the extras bundled with choosing a more expensive
    textbook is part of the ecosystem that I hadn't encountered.  This is probably
    something I should try to explore more and add to my later posting, <a href=\"http://dltj.org/article/complex-world-of-the-textbook/\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">The Complex World of the Textbook</a>.\r\n\r\nThanks, too, for
    your perspective, Bookstore Guy.  I'm not certain that the PIRGs are out to change
    the commercial publishers as much as they are trying to cut them out of the loop
    entirely based on a model of <span class=\"removed_link\" title=\"http://www.maketextbooksaffordable.org/statement.asp?id2=37614\">open
    access textbooks</span>.  As someone coming from the bookstore part of the ecosystem,

  content: "It has always seemed to me that the PIRGs have unrealistic expectations
    for publishers and if they think they can cut publishers out of the loop entirely,
    then they are again ignoring reality.\r\n\r\nFlat World Knowledge is hoping to
    make money by providing (selling) alternate media formats of  their open source
    textbooks.  I'm not sure this is a realistic model.  I think FWK is going to find
    it difficult to develop content that will meet the standards of the faculty of
    most universities.  And I doubt that there are that many faculty who are willing
    to spend the time and effort to properly develop a wiki textbook with little or
    no financial remuneration.  I just don't see it happening unless universities
    change the job description of faculty to include creating wiki textooks for their
    students and we know that most tenure seeking faculty are not encouraged to publish
    basic level textbooks. \r\n\r\nYour last question is the crux of the digital future.
    \ The bookstore needs to remain the focal point and the agregator of course materials.
    \ After all, we do not want to send our students on a cyber scavenger hunt to
    find their required course materials, do we?  Can you imagine going to 5 classes
    and getting 5 syllabi, each with an URL to a website which requires you to download
    your course materials?  And then going to the bookstore to pick up the few extra
    books that just aren't in digital format yet.  Crazy.\r\n\r\nMy vision of the
    future entails a student registering and then receiving a link to a bookstore
    website or a Learning Management System (Ohio and California already have these
    in the works.) which will allow them to see, purchase, and download all required
    digital course materials at one time.  It will also provide the opportunity to
    place an order or reservation with the bookstore for any additional physical textbooks
    as well as provide the opportunity to review and purchase any ancillary materials
    that would be of benefit to their education.  In such a scenario Flat World Knowledge
    would simply become another digital book to download.  I'd imagine bookstores
    could work a deal with FWK in which the bookstore would charge the student a nominal
    fee to enable the transfer of any wiki textbook.   Bookstores could also be involved
    in providing print versions on demand since we already create custom coursepacks
    and therefore have the mechanisms in place to provide this service.\r\n\r\nThe
    download itself will be possible because the bookstore will continue with it's
    current role of gathering course material information from the faculty--this is
    our toughest job.  And anybody who wants to jump into this process better be aware
    of the thousands of hours that go into collecting and verifying faculty course
    material requests. \r\n\r\nBTW, most of your forward thinking bookstore are already
    selling digital books and early signs indicate that we are on the cusp of the
    future.  It is going to grow slowly until we see somebody bring to the market
    a really good digital book reader and then it's going to happen so fast that we
    will be amazed."

  content: "Re: \"cut[ting] commercial publishers out of the loop entirely\":\r\n\r\nIt
    amazes me how blithely the work of hundreds of publishing professionals is dismissed
    or, even worse, not considered at all in discussions of textbooks and textbook
    prices.  If only those who speak so knowingly and optimistically about \"open
    source\" or \"wiki\" alternatives could see just how bare-bones, badly-written,
    and pedagogically moribund most textbook manuscripts are in their first (and even
    second) drafts, and if they could see just how many of the great aspects of the
    truly great textbooks (books like Campbell's BIOLOGY, for example, or Gardner's
    ART THROUGH THE AGES, and many others) originate with the publishers of those
    books, they might appreciate how much value--real, palpable value--publishers
    add to the material that the specialist-authors produce, and they might not be
    so sanguine about the possibility of open source content replacing teaching resources
    that are professionally edited and designed. \r\n\r\nThis isn't to say that textbook
    authors are clueless dolts or horrible writers.  Instead, the point is that producing
    an effective textbook is not something that just comes naturally to anyone, not
    even the most talented and beloved teachers.  The 'genre', if you will, functions
    in very specific ways---some of them counterintuitive---that don't correspond
    to the ways that a good lecture or class discussion functions.  The people who
    work in publishing possess a deep institutional well of knowledge about the structures
    that animate that particular genre.  Ask anyone who has authored a major college
    textbook how deeply their publisher was involved in the process.  Anyone who is
    honest (and whose book is truly a *major* college text) will respond in one of
    two ways:  1.) \"those guys were a royal pain in the butt\"; or 2.) \"I can't
    thank them enough for everything they did.\"  Both responses are evidence of the
    same thing: dozens of publishing professionals devoting thousands of hours of
    work to helping the author publish an effective and (one hopes) successful textbook.
    \ \r\n\r\nI don't presume to know the world  of library science so well as to
    declare that you all are obsolete in this new era of \"new media, new tools, new
    techniques, and new expectations\" (quoting one of your other posts).  Instead,
    I assume that librarians are working incredibly hard to adapt their skills to
    those new media and new realities, and are thereby ensuring that they will continue
    to offer a valuable service to other knowledge-workers well into the future.  \r\n\r\nHow
    do you imagine you would feel, however, if the entire public discourse about your
    profession was essentially reduced to a sweeping declaration that your services
    were no longer needed, and that the 'value' you claim to add to the information-stream
    is non-existent----a mere figment of your imagination?  \r\n\r\nJust sayin'."

  content: "In reading through both of the recent comments, I'm reminded of Clayton
    Christensen's phrase:  \"performance oversupply\".  <a class=\"imagelink\" style=\"float:
    right; width: 40%\" href=\"http://dltj.org/article/disruptive-innovation-card/\"
    title=\"Graph supporting the Theory of Disruptive Innovation\"><img id=\"image162\"
    style=\"width: 99%;\" src=\"http://dltj.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/christensen-graph.png\"
    alt=\"Graph supporting the Theory of Disruptive Innovation\" /></a>  It would
    seem to me that the producers (meaning both the publishers and the bookstores
    in this context) in the textbook marketplace have overshot the demands of certainly
    their least demanding customers and perhaps even their most demanding customers.
    \ (Somewhere between points 'a' and 'b' on the graph.)  Each actor continues to
    pile on more features and services that aren't really needed by the consumers
    (both students and instructors), and as such the market is ripe for another actor
    to disrupt the ecosystem with what Christensen would call a not-yet-good-enough
    product that is improving on a fast trajectory.  \r\n\r\nOpenly licensed textbooks
    could be that disruptive option.  They certainly are not good enough now, but
    have the potential to become good enough very fast.  If so, the least demanding
    customers will leave the incumbent producers -- and the incumbent producers may
    respond with a \"good riddance.\"  As the disruptive option gets better, it becomes
    good enough for the most demanding customer.  If the disruptive option competes
    favorably now on both price and performance, the incumbent loses.  (Point 'c'
    on the graph.)\r\n\r\nAnd, Peter, believe me when I say that I think academic
    libraries are facing such a disruption from Google in particular and the internet
    in general.  I'm not surprised by declarations that the profession's \"services
    [are] no longer needed, and that the 'value' [librarians] claim to add to the
    information-stream is non-existent.\"  I'm hip deep in it enough to say some of
    those very things about this profession.  (Hence the use of the <i>Jester</i>
    moniker in this blog -- to poke at the profession from within the castle walls.)
    \ Whether academic libraries survive in a recognizable fashion is a debatable
    point; it is by no means a certainty.  From what I've seen, so far, of the college
    textbook ecosystem, much the same could be said about its principle actors."

  content: "\"Performance oversupply\" is an interesting concept, but your use of
    it in this context gets the situation exactly backwards.  \r\n\r\nThe complex
    'educational solutions' that depend on new media delivery systems, aggregated
    collaboration, user customization, end-user initiated decision-making, and constant
    updating of both the content and the technology through which the content is consumed
    are MUCH better examples of \"performance oversupply\" than the textbooks that
    these educational solutions aspire to replace.  Survey after survey, focus group
    after focus group, faculty themselves tell us (and by \"us,\" I mean my company)
    that the various new initiatives create more work for them and produce no discernible
    improvement in students' learning.  These systems, so beloved by administrators
    and IT managers, offer too many features requiring too many separate decision-points,
    with not enough payoff. \r\n\r\nInterestingly, many of these new initiatives are
    doing precisely what Christensen would say is the wrong thing: trying to effect
    a wholesale revolution all at once, attempting to unseat traditional textbooks
    + ancillary packages completely, instead of heeding Christensen's main point,
    which is that they should be focusing on a very limited (and different) \"performance
    dimension\" from the one that the big textbook publishers currently operate on.
    \ The 'kitchen sink' quality of so many new-media educational initiatives is easy
    enough for existing publishers to undermine and simplify, as they surely will.\r\n\r\nAnd
    for those of us operating in the small- to mid-sized space in educational publishing,
    we're finding that we're picking up significant market-share with one-color, just-the-basics
    books (yes, traditional books--still the primary way that most people become acquainted
    with Clayton Christensen's ideas, by the way) that undercut the big publishers
    in price by 50% or more.  Imagine that.  No doubt the big three will continue
    to undermine their *own* established four-color behemoths with these sorts of
    'essentials' texts, too, as publishers have always done.  Publishing has been
    pretty good that way----always back-filling market niches with new, less expensive
    and more bare-bones alternatives that then are 'improved' in subsequent editions
    with additions and ancillaries requested by their 'best customers'.  The fact
    that the publishing industry manages not only to move one product up the performance
    curve but ALSO create new products that fill in the space further down the curve
    seems to me to argue for seeing publishing as pretty good at managing the 'dilemma'
    that Christensen describes."

    that aren't really needed by the consumers...\"  I went on to describe how openly
    licensed textbooks is a potentially disrupting innovation (from Christensen's
    perspective) to that ecosystem.  \r\n\r\nIt is interesting to think about your
    own strategy as well.  His book also speaks of the \"Basis of Competition\" --
    four stages of product competition.  He uses a hierarchy devised by Windermere
    Associates in which there are these four metrics that a consumer uses to measure
    products:  performance, reliability, convenience, and price.  When all other factors
    are equal at one metric, the basis of competition in the marketplace shifts to
    the next factor.  It sounds like your company is making a conscious decision not
    to accelerate along the functionality trajectory (and the corresponding rat-race)
    and is instead focusing on the other factors of competition."

  content: "I had forgotten all about this thread.\r\n\r\nConsider the disruptive
    technology i.e. open source textbooks.  They will be replacing a medium whose
    management is paid for directly by students.    Collecting the textbook list from
    the faculty of a university and then providing those course materials for sale
    is a very expensive task.  Open source textbooks would likely shift costs from
    the bookstore to the University and that means the students still get to pay,
    this time in the form of additional tuition.     \r\n\r\nOne would assume that
    an open source textbook needs to be developed by a university faculty member.
    \ Realistically, the time spent developing and maintaining the textbook would
    replace time that a faculty member would have spent doing something productive
    for the university.   This will be an invisible expense at first, but soon the
    university will figure out why certain faculty are not as productive as they used
    to be.  \r\n\r\nThe more obvious expense comes from the fact that the bookstore
    would be unable to sell open source textbooks.  Thus, the course materials department
    for a bookstore would not be able to sustain itself.  It would then have to turn
    its course materials aggregation and distribution duties over to the university.
    \ Granted, the extent to which the university chooses or needs to pursue these
    new duties may be very different in the distant future, but in the near future
    this could be a huge expense.\r\n\r\nSo, the question that needs to be answered
    is which is the more efficient model?"

  content: "If nothing is sold, as is potentially the case with open access textbooks,
    what is the point of collecting textbook lists from faculty?  Isn't developing
    course material a valuable thing for a faculty member to do?  (It might not be
    as highly valued in the promotion/tenure process as research and publication at
    this point, but there are signs that this is changing.)  If content distribution
    happens online and is a faculty-driven activity based on the needs outlined in
    the faculty's syllabus, are there any more course materials aggregation and distribution
    duties?\r\n\r\nThat is the disruptive nature of open access textbooks."

  content: "I seem to have lost my better written reply.  Here's the short version.\r\n\r\nHaving
    read thousands of syllabi, I'm not sure you want to leave this task in the hands
    of the faculty.\r\n\r\nAlso, aggregation is necessary to ensure that course materials
    can be used by disabled students.  I think California has been heavily involved
    in this."

<p>There has been an increasing focus on the cost of textbooks in the mainstream media this year, and I don't think it is the case that I'm just becoming more sensitized to it.  Take for example the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/07/AR2008020700627.html" title="Required Reading - washingtonpost.com">editorial from the Washington Post on February 7th</a>.  The second paragraph succinctly describes the issues being debated most often:<br />
<blockquote>There are several reasons that textbooks are so costly. For one, even though there have been no major advances in fields such as calculus and elementary physics in decades or even centuries, publishers still churn out new editions of textbooks on these subjects every three or four years. The changes are typically superficial, but they prevent students from being able to purchase used, older editions. Publishers also frequently bundle unwanted additional materials such as CD-ROMs and study guides with textbooks. Professors rarely assign these extra materials, which drive up costs, and students often cannot sell the books back to bookstores once the shrink-wrap has been removed. Publishers can get away with these shenanigans because there's a fundamental disconnect in the textbook marketplace: The people paying for the books (the students) are not the ones choosing them (the teachers).</p></blockquote>
<p>  The editorial goes on to suggest that what is needed is regulation "to ensure that both students and professors are able to make informed choices" -- regulation of the kind proposed in <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-h4137/show" title="House Bill H.R.4137 via Open Congress.">House bill H.R. 4137</a> (<a href="http://dltj.org/article/hr4137-on-textbooks/">covered on <acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester"><i>DLTJ</i></acronym> earlier</a>).</p>
<p>The <a href="http://theboard.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/10/that-textbook-costs-how-much-200/" title="Editorial:  That Textbook Costs How Much? $200?">New York Times has a posting on their editorial blog on April 10th</a> that follows up on the federal legislation.  It says that the House and Senate versions are currently being reconciled in a conference committee, and goes on to summaries the key points of the House-proposed legislation.</p>
<p>The public radio program <a href="http://www.marketplace.org/topics/life/textbook-costs-getting-hard-cover" title="Marketplace: Textbook costs getting hard to cover">Marketplace had a feature on April 15th that covered textbooks</a>.  It also had a statement that I hadn't heard in other stories:<br />
<blockquote>[Executive director of Higher Education for the American Association of Publishers Bruce] Hildebrand says it costs a lot to produce multi-color glossy pages and the other materials teachers want, like lecture notes, PowerPoint slides and exam questions. In effect, students are paying higher prices to make life easier for their professors. They usually don't even know what the prices are.</p></blockquote>
<p>  While I've heard the claim before that professor's don't know the true costs of textbooks and have a hard time finding that information, this is the first time I've heard that "students are paying higher prices to make life easier for their professors."  I'm not necessarily buying that.  In fact, there was a comment from a listener who teaches biology that was broadcast on yesterday's show refuting that.  The listener says "That is completely ridiculous. Even if I were to use only the slides that they provide, it would still take me hours per lecture to write a lecture the first time."</p>
<p>Then there was news on April 16th about the Public Interest Research Group <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.maketextbooksaffordable.org/statement.asp?id2=42398">announcement that they had reach 1,000 signatures</span> on an <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.maketextbooksaffordable.org/statement.asp?id2=37614">online petition to make textbooks affordable</span> including the use of <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.maketextbooksaffordable.org/statement.asp?id2=37633#what">open textbooks</span>, when available.  The trade periodical <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2008/04/16/textbooks" title="Professors Gone Paperless in Inside Higher Ed">Inside Higher Ed was one that published an article about the PIRG's accomplishment</a>.  AAP's Bruce Hildebrand praised the effort (that would ironically reduce traditional publisher revenue), saying "any faculty member or group that is willing to make that level of commitment to provide a free textbook, I applaud them."  He then goes on to caution that content creators are assuming the role of publisher, along with all of the duties to keep the content updated and integrate it into instructional systems.  This article also lists several examples of how <a href="http://cnx.org/content/m14466/latest/" title="OER Introduction">Open Educational Resources</a> is gaining ground, including a description of a management school professor who stopped using traditional textbooks 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Lots of activity here; it is definitely worth keeping an eye on.
