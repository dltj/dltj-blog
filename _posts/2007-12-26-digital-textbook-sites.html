    Hi, In case your readers might be interested in potential
    disruptive innovations in the textbook market, I've included links
    to my articles on the economic case for creative commons textbooks.

  content: Thanks for the links to your articles, Fred.  Open access textbooks is
    also part of the overall strategy we're considering, and your articles make a
    good case for doing that.

    we not also shift the paradigm from commercial to open?\r\n\r\nStudents have watched
    how disruptive technology changed the music industry -  intellectual property
    in digital form takes as much effort to control as to produce.  We are skeptical
    that the current digital textbook frenzy, if focused only on commercial providers,
    will lead to yet another rip-off scheme. \r\n\r\nIt's all well and good shift
    the paradigm to \"get with the times\", but if we enrich learning environments,
    increase outcomes and so on through digital textbooks but students STILL can't
    afford them...well...what's the point?\r\n\r\nHere are the digital books we're

<p>This topic is a bit far from "library technology" but part of my day job at OhioLINK has been involved with research on digital textbooks.  To that end, I've been looking at companies that sell a digital form of the printed-and-bound textbook.  The sites that I've found are summarized below; I would appreciate comments (public or private) that list other sites that you know about so this list can be as comprehensive as possible.  Also, if you happen to be researching the same area, please get in touch if you are interested in comparing notes.  The list is broken down into two parts, and the companies are listed alphabetically within each part.</p>
<h2>Page-for-Page Replications</h2>
<p>This is the most prevalent category -- those companies that offer a page-for-page replication of the paper edition of the textbook.</p>
<ul type="square">
<li><a href="http://ebooks.bfwpub.com/" title="">Bedford Freeman Worth Publishing</a>, BFW only</li>
<li><a href="http://www.booksonboard.com/" title="">Books On Board</a>, multi-publisher	</li>
<li><a href="http://www.coursesmart.com/" title="">CourseSmart</a>, multi-publisher	</li>
<li><a href="http://www.digitaltextbooks.com/" title="">Digital Textbooks</a>, multi-publisher</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ichapters.com/" title="">iChapters</a>, Cengage Learning only? (formerly Thompson Learning)</li>
<li><span class="removed_link" title="http://create.mcgraw-hill.com/wordpress-mu/welcomeprimisuser/">Primus</span>, McGraw-Hill only</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vitalsource.com/index/bookshelf" title="">VitalSource</a>, multi-publisher</li>
<li><a href="http://textbooks.zinio.com/" title="">Zino Digital Textbooks</a>, McGraw-Hill only</li>
</ul>
<h2>Enhanced Digital Editions</h2>
<p>In addition to the text of the textbook, these enhanced editions include video, audio, simulations, pre- and post-tests, online glossaries, and/or links to supplemental materials.  Part of our research is testing the extent to which these enhanced editions can improve educational outcomes.  I'm aware of sites for specific textbooks, but for the purpose of this list I'm seeking out sites that aggregate the sale of many textbooks under one banner.</p>
<ul type="square">
<li><a href="http://college.hmco.com/eduspace/" title="">Eduspace</a>, Houghton Mifflin only</li>
<li><a href="http://edugen.wiley.com/edugen/secure/index.uni?protocol=http" title="">Wiley Plus</a>, Wiley Publishing only</li>
</ul>
<p>If you know of other sources -- for either type of digital textbooks -- please get in touch with me.
