  content: "The core of the problem seems unresolvable for the proprietary commercial
    vendors: there is simply not enough growth in the traditional relationship to
    support the kind of competitive and responsive marketplace that customers need.
    In turn, their struggle to remain viable businesses have left them reluctant to
    move away from the arcane pay-per-use business model that treats customers as
    competitors.\r\n\r\nOur role in this relationship is to not look elsewhere for
    solutions - either in the community or with competitors - and remain with the
    One Vendor to Do it All. And let's not forget to  \"re-purchase\" your ILS every
    couple of years too, with the latest \"special\" upgrade 'that's not included
    with annual maintenance' etc.  \r\n\r\nSome enterprising upstarts are challenging
    this, but I think most of the innovation and change will be catalyzed from the
    open source camps, where investments are just starting to rock 'n roll.."

  content: "While not trying to duck the issues you quite rightly highlight, I would
    point out that the questions were in the present tense.  Answering with 'our products
    <em>will</em> integrate, etc., etc.', would have no doubt drawn equal scepticism,
    but for different reasons.\r\n\r\nThe answers you picked out are symptomatic of
    an industry in transition.  Transition from products without exception based on
    architectures that never envisioned light-weight loosely-coupled integration.
    Transition to a REST based service oriented architecture where integration between
    library and non-library applications should be simple and based on simple and
    open standards.\r\n\r\nThe \"<em>Do you have partnerships with other LMS/ERM vendors?</em>\"
    question in the survey demonstrates an attachment to traditional thinking towards
    integration.  So far, with the traditional heavy-weight protocols we are used
    to in the library world, the only reliable way to get integration that works has
    been through a partnership between suppliers.  Web 2.0 has demonstrated that with
    simple light-weight protocols, integration is possible without the need for commercial
    partnerships.  There are many benefits that arise from partnerships, but they
    shouldn't be a prerequisite for successful integration.\r\n\r\nIt is not all doom
    and gloom though.  Initiatives such as the <a href=\"http://project.library.upenn.edu/confluence/display/ilsapi/Home\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">DLF's ILS API</a> defining simple REST base protocols that all
    vendors should be able to support, have started to gather momentum in the last
    few months.  A momentum that appears to be supported both by vendors and open
    source groups.\r\n\r\n<em>Ah but will the vendors support such APIs?</em> I hear
    you ask.  For an insight in to the surprisingly open and forward thinking of at
    least three of the vendors, I recommend a listen to <span class=\"removed_link\"
    title=\"http://librarygang.talis.com/2008/05/06/may-2008-ils-api/\">last month's
    Library 2.0 Gang podcast </span> (the position of the fourth even gets a mention).<p

  content: "@George -- I agree with your statement:  the marketplace is in an unhealthy
    feedback loop.  I also agree that the shake-up is likely to come from open source
    projects.  The twist that you left unmentioned is the role of commercial support
    options for open source projects.  The <a href=\"http://dltj.org/article/aligning-clashing-values/\"
    \ rel=\"nofollow\">dynamics between customer and vendor are considerably different
    when the object of the support is an open source system</a> -- the ability to
    move from one support vendor to another unsticks much of unhealthy feedback loop.\r\n\r\n@Richard
    -- you correctly bring up the issue of the form of the question...it is a historical
    look at past integrations and not necessarily a statement of planned or future
    integration.  We actually have a common phrase for that here in America -- <i>\"Past
    Performance is No Guarantee of Future Results\"</i> -- something that is <a href=\"http://beginnersinvest.about.com/od/investstrategiesstyles/a/aa081906a.htm\"rel=\"nofollow\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">included in any manner of financial service offering</a>.\r\n\r\nYour
    points about the industry in transition -- of heavy-weight and light-weight integrations
    -- are well articulated.  That said, I also subscribe to <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/claytonchristensen/2008/05/05/microsoft-yahoo-google-lead-clayton_in_cc_0505claytonchristensen_inl.html\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">Clayton Christensen's theory that an organizations resources,
    processes and values make it very difficult for it to change direction</a>.  In
    this case, to move from heavy-weight to light-weight interfaces.  Even if the
    soul of the company is willing, Christensen theorizes that the organization would
    have to stop listening to its best customers in order to achieve the shift.  In
    such cases, <i>Past Performance is really a Very Strong Indicator of Future Results.</i>\r\n\r\n\r\nThank
    you to both of you for your comments."

<p><a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/media/documents/programmes/resourcediscovery/lmsstudy.pdf" title="JISC/SCONUL LMS Report"><img src="http://dltj.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/jisc-lms-report-753121.gif" alt="" title="Coverpage of the JISC/SCONUL LMS Report" width="141" height="200" class="alignright size-full wp-image-376" style="border:1px solid grey;" /></a> In the course of putting together the JISC/SCONUL Library Management Systems Study, the authors interviewed the four major vendors of integrated library systems in higher education in the U.K.:  <a href="http://www.exlibrisgroup.com/" title="Ex Libris homepage">Ex Libris</a>, <a href="http://www.iii.com/" title="Innovative Interfaces homepage">Innovative Interfaces</a>, <a href="http://www.sirsidynix.com/" title="SirsiDynix homepage">SirsiDynix</a> and <a href="http://www.talis.com/" title="Talis homeage">Talis</a>.  Among the "who are you" and "what do you do" questions were two that get to the heart of what many of us are clamoring for from our vendors:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do your products interoperate with products those from other LMS/ERM vendors?</li>
<li>Do you have partnerships with other LMS/ERM vendors?</li>
</ul>
<p>Since three of the four are also leading vendors in North America (and I'm betting the fourth would like to be one as well), I think it is instructive to look at how these four vendors answer these two questions. ((Adamson, V., Bacsich, P., Chad, K., Kay, D., &amp; Plenderleith, J. (2008). <span style="font-style:italic;">JISC &amp; SCONUL Library Management Systems Study</span>. 156 p. Retrieved April 17, 2008, from <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/media/documents/programmes/resourcediscovery/lmsstudy.pdf" title="JISC/SCONUL Library Management Systems Study">http://www.jisc.ac.uk/media/documents/programmes/resourcediscovery/lmsstudy.pdf</a>.))</p>
<blockquote><h2>Ex Libris</h2>
<h3>How do ExLibris products interoperate with products those from other LMS/ERM vendors?</h3>
<p>We interoperate with our own products first (e.g. Primo and MetaLib) but all new products designed to interoperate more widely by means of standards </p>
<h3>Does ExLibris have partnerships with other LMS/ERM vendors?</h3>
<p>With Talis for Verde </p>
<h2>Innovative Interfaces</h2>
<h3>How do Innovative products interoperate with those from other LMS/ERM<br />
vendors? </h3>
<p>Our history is rooted in providing products that interoperated with other products.  This continues with ERM for example </p>
<h3>Does Innovative have partnerships with other LMS/ERM vendors?</h3>
<p>No. Our aim is to provide best of breed across the whole range of library needs. Of course we don't stand in the way of libraries that wish for example to add Aquabrowser or Endeca. However we want to provide solutions that are better. To date, we haven't seen a big groundswell for these types of products...for all of the press and interest it has gotten, products like Endeca haven't made a major dent in the marketplace. </p>
<h2>SirsiDynix</h2>
<h3>How do SirsiDynix products interoperate with those from other LMS/ERM<br />
vendors?</h3>
<p>Z39.50 and other, APIs (SD has been doing this API stuff for over 15 years). We work with other vendors through our certification programme -- in particular for SIP2 and NCIP.  All other ILS vendors are supported through Z39.50 as well as federated search programs. </p>
<h3>Partnerships with other LMS/ERM vendors?</h3>
<p>No genuine partnerships with LMS competitors (e.g. to cross sell products).  </p>
<p>Deeper integration is available for resource sharing and ILL. </p>
<h2>Talis<br />
</h2>
<h3>How do Talis products interoperate with those from other LMS/ERM vendors? </h3>
<p>Talis List integrates with all LMSs and Talis Base does too (via Ztarget). Gateway (EDI) will interoperate but it not quite there yet. We work with other link resolvers, self-serve, and SRU/SRW services etc </p>
<p>Keystone is focussed on our own LMS for now but is designed to enable interoperability with other LMSs. Anything new we develop is standards based to work with other LMS and as appropriate with other external system </p>
<h3>Partnerships with other LMS/ERM vendors </h3>
<p>The only formal relationship is with ExLibris. Our Connexions programme includes working with ExLibris with Verde but there were some problems because Verde didn't support 1Cate (now OCLC resolver), which the customer wanted to continue to use.</p></blockquote>
<p>In section 4.41 of the report ("The staff perspective on the LMS"), the authors quote a passage from Carl Grant's blog ((Grant, Carl. (2007 Jul 4) <i>A symphony out of tune: when companies go deaf</i>. Care-Affiliates blog. Retrieved 13-Jun-2008 from <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071231052258/http://www.care-affiliates.com/thoughts/archives/6" title="">http://www.care-affiliates.com/thoughts/archives/6</a>.)):  "These companies have become unresponsive to the collective goals of our profession and, like so much of our society these days, are no longer focused on the we but the me. It is a sad state of affairs and one that will not be tolerated."  There is a growing desire from the library community, particularly in the U.K. with the formal study of the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080925152136/http://www.jisc.ac.uk:80/whatwedo/themes/information_environment.aspx" title="Information environment : JISC">JISC Information Environment</a> for higher education institutions, to have systems interoperate in a clean, service-oriented architecture kind of way.</p>
<p>The vendor responses, on the other hand, would seem to be more akin to one-upmanship and isolationism:  we look to interoperate with ourselves before others, we'll interoperate if we're at the center, you're on your own if you want to try to integrate another product with ours, we'll interoperate if others play by our rules.  This isn't what the customer is looking for.</p>
<p>Too harsh of an assessment?  Let me know in the comments.</p>
