<p>I've moved the bibliography of the theory of disruptive innovation as applied to libraries and higher education to a <a href="/christensen-bibliography/" title="Bibliography of Christensen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Theory of Disruptive Technology&rdquo; applied to Libraries and Higher Education">new location</a>.  If you are reading this posting directly from the DLTJ website, you'll also find it linked under the "about" header as "bibliography".</p>
<p>The bibliography has also been updated to include the new (to me) paper <a href="/article/christensen-on-disruption-in-education/">mentioned on Monday</a> and David Lewis' presentation to the OhioLINK directors last week.</p>
