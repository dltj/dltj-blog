<p> Another week, another set of threads of library and library-related topics.  (Who ever said this profession was boring?  Well, I once did, but that is a thread for another day.)  <a href="#teaching-search">Information literacy hit the mainstream this week</a> with noted usability analyst Jakob Nielson noting that internet users need to learn better search skills and Google giving us a tool (in the form of a daily puzzle) that might do just that.  Next is an <a href="#oclc-rlp">announcement from OCLC</a> about a re-energizing and re-forming of the research library partner program.  Lastly, a computer scientist at Miami University creates a <a href="#shelvar">mobile app</a> that will be a godsend for library shelvers everywhere (perhaps after you relabel your spines).</p>
<p>Feel free to send this to others you think might be interested in the topics.  If you find these threads interesting and useful, you might want to add the <a href="http://feeds.dltj.org/thursday-threads/" title="RSS Feed for DLTJ Thursday Threads">Thursday Threads RSS Feed</a> to your feed reader or subscribe to e-mail delivery using the form to the right.  If you would like a more raw and immediate version of these types of stories, watch <a href="http://friendfeed.com/dltj" title="Peter Murray - FriendFeed">my FriendFeed stream</a> (or subscribe to <a href="http://friendfeed.com/dltj?format=atom" title="Atom feed for Peter Murray's FriendFeed account">its feed</a> in your feed reader).

<h2 id="teaching-search">On the Need, and Perhaps a Tool, to Teach Search</h2>
<blockquote><p>Although some analysts questioned the finding of <strong>search dominance</strong>, it's a user behavior that gets stronger every year. Today, many users are so reliant on search that it's undermining their problem-solving abilities. Ironically, <strong>the better search gets, the more dangerous it gets</strong> as people increasingly assume that whatever the search engine coughs up must be <em>the</em> answer. ...</p>
<p>In the long term, we should try to improve the world rather than design to suit its shortcomings. One example of how we might do this is to teach better Internet research skills in schools.</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://agoogleaday.com/" title="A Google a Day">A Google a Day</a> is a new daily puzzle that can be solved using your creativity and clever search skills on Google. Questions will be posted every day on <a href="http://agoogleaday.com/" title="A Google a Day">agoogleaday.com</a> and printed on weekdays above the <i>New York Times</i> crossword puzzle. We&rsquo;ll reveal each puzzle&rsquo;s answer the next day in the <i>Times</i> and on <a href="http://agoogleaday.com/" title="A Google a Day">agoogleaday.com</a>, along with the search tips and features used to find it.</p>
<p>Just like traditional crossword puzzles, the difficulty of the questions increases over the course of the week, so by Thursday or Friday, even the most seasoned searcher may be stumped.

<p>Interesting that these two items showed up within days of each other.  How can we improve the skills of internet users?  By making it a game, of course.  This sort of thing strikes me as a good way for libraries to promote information literacy skills.  Syndicated to the New York Times?  How about syndicating it to library websites!  (I've sent feedback to Google to see if this sort of thing is possible.)</p>
<h2 id="oclc-rlp">An early word about the OCLC Research Library Partnership</h2>
<blockquote><p>OCLC Research Library Partners will be part of a leading-edge, peer-based, transnational collaborative. Institutions will participate in a challenging and rewarding set of activities designed to improve the information-driven environment in which your students and scholars work. Partners&rsquo; efforts will be backed by the full capacities of OCLC Research, and Partners will collectively influence and direct a substantial portion of the OCLC Research effort. Institutions will have an opportunity to share expertise with some of the most innovative and forward-thinking library managers and leaders in the world.</p>

<p>I only worked briefly at an <acronym title="Research Library Group">RLG</acronym> library and in that short time never really got introduced to what it meant to be a member of RLG.  Now that RLG has been OCLC Research for about five years, OCLC is now looking to <a href="http://www.oclc.org/research/partnership/newpartnership.htm" title="OCLC Research Library Partnership | OCLC - RLG Partnership">re-engergize and expand communication</a> between research libraries.  The expanded effort is set to launch on July 1st.</p>
<h2 id="shelvar">Shelvar, the Augmented Reality Shelf-reading App</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_shelvar_video" align="alignright" width="230" caption="YouTube Video demonstrating the Shelvar app"]<iframe title="YouTube video player" width="229" height="159" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/NgZVI630SsI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>[/caption]<br />
<blockquote>Putting misshelved books back in their proper places is not a library worker&rsquo;s favorite task. It takes time and it&rsquo;s not exactly scintillating. Now a computer-science professor has come up with a way to make the process faster and less burdensome: an augmented-reality shelf-reading app that can scan an entire shelf&rsquo;s worth of books at a time and alert workers which ones are out of place.

<p>This one warms my heart because it comes from my <i>alma mater</i>, <a href="http://www.miami.muohio.edu/" title="Miami University homepage">Miami University</a>'s Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering.  It is an app for mobile device that scans two-dimensional barcodes on the spines of books and shows, in real time, which ones are out of place.  This <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgZVI630SsI" title="YouTube<br />
        - Augmented Reality App for Shelf Reading">4-minute video demonstrates how it works</a>.  In comments on the YouTube video, Dr. Brinkman says: "Sorry, the application is still under development, and is not available for other people to try yet. If everything goes well we will be soliciting for beta-test partners some time around Christmas."</p>
