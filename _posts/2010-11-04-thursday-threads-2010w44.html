  content: "Where are you learning that Google Books uses anonymized circulation information?
    I don't see that in the article you link to, curious to learn more. \r\n\r\n\"we
    can safely conclude that there is a broad consensus against principles of RDA\"
    -- just leaves me puzzled. How about the authors provide some evidence of this
    'broad consensus', or at least their own personal problems with the \"principles
    of RDA\"?   Making a statement like that with no evidence or argument whatsoever,
    I am neither convinced there is such a consensus (I was not under that impression),
    nor sure what the authors problems are exactly.  I am not neccesarily a fan of
    RDA -- although I think it's _trying_ to do the right thing, whether it succeeds
    (or possibly makes things worse) is something I'm not sure of -- but some people
    are opposed to any kind of change at all, or are opposed to (or simply don't understand)
    even what RDA is trying to do, and if those people are really a 'consensus', then
    I continue to fear for the future of library metadata control."

  content: "Ah - the TheAtlantic article mentioned using library holdings data, not
    circulation data, in relevance ranking.  It was something that was mentioned at
    the ALCTS Forum earlier this year by Kurt Groetsch, Technical Collections Specialist
    at Google.\r\n\r\nI don't fully understand the RDA Revolt either.  I think it
    has something to do with RDA-coded authority records.  This is likely more of
    a back-story, but I don't have time to dig it out..."

  content: "RE: RDA revolt - Mary Mastraccio has posted about the authority record
    issue that is the probable cause of the petition. The post is at AUTOCAT at http://article.gmane.org/gmane.education.libraries.autocat/35108
    . If you have access to the Cooperative Cataloging Rules listserv/Google Group,
    Mary and James W. have been debating back and forth about the matter as well.\r\n\r\nBut,
    yeah, the petition suffers from an identity crisis. Some just want the OCLC-RDA
    test guidelines to change, while others see this as an opportunity to declare
    that RDA is DOA and we should stay with AACR2 - the latter being much louder than
    the former."

  content: Ah, thanks Becky.  That does seem to be a clear-headed response to the
    hubbub.  Could it be just fear-of-the-new?

<p> This week is a mostly Google edition of <i><acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester">DLTJ</acronym></i> <a href="/category/thursday-threads/">Thursday Threads</a>.  Below is a high-level overview of Google's Book Search algorithm, how Google is helping web servers improve the speed at which content loads, and how Google's internet traffic is growing as a percentage of all internet traffic.  But first, there is an uprising on the RDA test records in the WorldCat database.</p>

<h2>Memorandum Against RDA Test</h2>
<blockquote><p>We have found ourselves in an unenviable position of opposing the work that supposedly has been authorized by agencies representing our interests. I might compare it to a military coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat. I mean here the RDA &ldquo;test&rdquo; and its implications on the cataloging world at large. After extensive discussions on the PCC, OCLC cataloging e-mail lists with opinions from the British Library, Australia and North America, we can safely conclude that there is a broad consensus against principles of RDA and the way RDA &ldquo;test&rdquo; has been imposed on the cataloging world.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://listserv.oclc.org/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind1011a&amp;L=oclc-cat&amp;D=0&amp;F=P&amp;T=0&amp;X=5D7D8800A8770C99F0&amp;P=2298" title="OCLC-CAT post &#039;November 2010 Memorandum Against RDA Test&#039; by Wojciech Siemaszkiewicz">original post on the OCLC-CAT list</a> by Wojciech Siemaszkiewicz of the New York Public Library is behind a must-subscribe-and-authenticate form, but it has been copied out <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/oclc-cat-rda.txt" title="Public copy of OCLC-CAT post 'November 2010 Memorandum Against RDA Test' by Wojciech Siemaszkiewicz">copied to an open website</a> by Becky Yoose (thanks, Becky!).  The subsequent discussion resulted in a <a href="http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/norda/" title="Memorandum Against RDA Test">Petition against the RDA Test</a> by Jacqueline Byrd at Indiana University.  The link to the position has been <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.education.libraries.autocat/35094" title="Gmane -- Mail To News And Back Again">posted to the open AUTOCAT list</a>, and there has been <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.education.libraries.autocat/35108" title="Gmane -- Mail To News And Back Again">subsequent</a> <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.education.libraries.autocat/35109" title="Gmane -- Mail To News And Back Again">discussion</a> <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.education.libraries.autocat/35114" title="Gmane -- Mail To News And Back Again">there</a>.

<h2>Inside the Google Books Algorithm</h2>
<blockquote><p>Rich Results is the latest in a series of smaller front-end tweaks that have been matched by backend improvements. Now, the book search algorithm takes into account more than 100 "signals," individual data categories that Google statistically integrates to rank your results. When you search for a book, Google Books doesn't just look at word frequency or how closely your query matches the title of a book. They now take into account web search frequency, recent book sales, the number of libraries that hold the title, and how often an older book has been reprinted.</p></blockquote>
<p>Alexis Madrigal <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/11/inside-the-google-books-algorithm/65422/" title="Inside the Google Books Algorithm - Alexis Madrigal - Technology - The Atlantic">article</a> in TheAtlantic.com draws a comparison between the techniques and algorithms used for web search with those used for book materials.  The need for relevant search results is the same, but books don't have the same inter-page linking hints that drive the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank" title="PageRank | Wikipedia">PageRank</a> algorithm for web search.  The use of <a href="/article/mashups-of-bib-data/#anonymized_circulation_data">anonymized circulation data</a> in creating clustered bibliographic descriptions was mentioned at the ALA Midwinter ALCTS Forum on Mashups of Bibliographic Data, and apparently it is also used in the relevance ranking of Google Books search results.  (Hat tip to Ron Murray.)</p>
<h2>Google Releases mod_pagespeed</h2>
<blockquote><p>mod_pagespeed is an open-source Apache module that automatically optimizes web pages and resources on them. It does this by rewriting the resources using filters that implement web performance best practices. Webmasters and web developers can use mod_pagespeed to improve the performance of their web pages when serving content with the Apache HTTP Server. mod_pagespeed includes several filter that optimize JavaScript, HTML and CSS stylesheets. It also includes filters for optimizing JPEG and PNG images. The filters are based on a set of best practices known to enhance web page performance. Webmasters who set up mod_pagespeed in addition to configuring proper caching and compression on their Apache distribution should expect to see an improvement in the loading time of the pages on their websites.</p></blockquote>
<p>Google has promoted <a href="http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/" title="Page Speed Home | Google Code">best practices for improving the rate at which web pages load</a> for a number of years.  This week they introduced <a href="http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/docs/module.html" title="mod_pagespeed Overview | Google Code">mod_pagespeed</a>: an Apache web server module that brings these practices to bear by rewriting HTML, JavaScript, and Cascading Style Sheets on-the-fly.  Since Google now includes the <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2010/04/using-site-speed-in-web-search-ranking.html" title="Using site speed in web search ranking | Google Webmaster Central Blog">speed at which pages are rendered in a browser as a factor in ranking search results</a>, this would seem to be a good module to explore for anyone running an Apache web server with public content.  (<a href="http://friendfeed.com/edsu/3fa00167/official-google-webmaster-central-blog-make" title="Official Google Webmaster Central Blog: Make your... - Ed Summers - FriendFeed">Hat tip to Ed Summers</a>.)</p>

<h2>Google Sets Internet Traffic Record</h2>
<blockquote><p>Google now represents an average 6.4% of all Internet traffic around the world. This number grows even larger (to as much as 8-12%) if I include estimates of traffic offloaded by the increasingly common Google Global Cache (GGC) deployments and error in our data due to the extremely high degree of Google edge peering with consumer networks. Keep in mind that these numbers represent increased market share &mdash; Google is growing considerably faster than overall Internet volumes which are already increasing 40-45% each year.</p></blockquote>
<p>Craig Labovitz of Arbor Networks <a href="http://asert.arbornetworks.com/2010/10/google-breaks-traffic-record/" title="Google Sets New Internet Traffic Record | Security to the Core | Arbor Networks Security">notes</a> that if Google were an internet service provider, it would now be "the second largest carrier on the planet."  Wow!  That is a lot of data sloshing around on its own internal network!
