  content: "Peter, Bill\r\n\r\nA couple of responses:\r\n\r\nFirst, Peter asks \"Here&rsquo;s
    a good question: can one take the open access article data from BMC and construct
    competing value-added services? Based on reading point #8 in BMC&rsquo;s Terms
    and Conditions9, it would appear not.)\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAbsolutely you can - that
    is the whole point of the Creative Commons Attribution license under which all
    the open access research that we publish made available. As long as you appropriately
    attribute the source, both commercial and non-commercial reuse of the content
    is allowed. Point #4 makes this clear.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll points 8 and 9 of the Terms
    and Conditions of the website are saying is that the other content on our websites
    (i.e. the general information pages, FAQs etc) are (c) BioMed Central. \r\n\r\nYou
    might ask why that's important? In fact, it's more important than you might think.
    We recently had a situation where a competing commercial publisher had plagiarized
    large chunks of our site (including our detailed 'instructions for authors') word-for-word
    and was re-using that material (without any form of acknowledgement) to set up
    a series of competing commercial open access journals. \r\n\r\n\r\nSecondly, Bill:\r\n\r\nBioMed
    Central is most definitely not, and never has been, a spammer. We take privacy
    and related email-marketing policy issues very seriously - our reputation depends
    on it\r\n\r\nUsers who register on BioMed Central have to explicitly check an
    additional box if they wish to opt-in to receive information from third parties
    about products relevant to their interests. If you do not ask to receive this
    information, you will not be sent it - however many people do ask to receive it,
    and find it a useful source of product information.\r\n\r\nIn addition, like many
    other journals such as Nature (for profit), Science (not for profit) and the PLoS
    titles (not for profit), BioMed Central incorporates appropriate advertising sponsorship
    within its journal content, in the form of banner ads and keyword-driven text
    ads. These ads are intended to be relevant to the user, and they help to defray
    the cost of publishing, so that it does not have to be carried entirely by the
    academic research community. Ironically, in this respect, the advertising carried
    by BioMed Central is an example of exactly the type of broadening of the base
    of financial support that Yale Library called for."

  content: Matt, thanks for the thoughtful response.  Maybe I'm a bit of a crank when
    it comes to commercial email and advertising in general.  Also, I shouldn't have
    conflated a proper opt-in (box unchecked by default -- not spam) with opt-out.  Did
    Peter have to check a box to wind up getting the email he posted above?

    but the language of the Terms and Conditions is not clear.  Perhaps it is a problem
    in translation -- either from British English to American English or from Legalese
    to English.  These are the relevant parts:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>4.  All articles

    doubt I signed up for this information -- I'm not even sure I have created a BMC
    account in the nearly three years I've been working for OhioLINK.  Since OhioLINK
    receives a feed of BMC article content for its own electronic journal center,
    it is possible that an overreaching marketing engine harvested OhioLINK staff
    e-mail addresses to add to its database.  (In my position at OhioLINK, I get a
    lot of mail like this and didn't really consider it Spam even if it was unsolicited.)
    \ The contents of the email, though, did serve as a launching-off point for a
    review of the nature of BMC itself."

    heard of them before, let alone requested that my address be added to their list.  I

<p>My posting on Friday about the <a href="/article/clashing-values/">clashing values of academic institutions and businesses</a> prompted a comment from <a href="/article/clashing-values/#comment-20402">Bill Hooker</a> about linking to his blog posting about the pricing structure at BioMed Central (BMC). His comment and the e-mail I received this morning from BMC (reproduced below) got me rethinking about the nature of open access publishing.</p>
<h2>What is BioMed Central?</h2>
<p>It is a business.  It has advertising (even an "Sales and Marketing Director" listed on its "<a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/info/about/whoweare" title="BioMed Central Management Team description">In-House Team</a>" page) and it generates revenue for services beyond the per-article charge at the time of publication.  As the e-mail below says, one can purchase "direct emails and keyword search term sponsorship" from BMC.  To the best of my understanding of U.K. tax law, it is not a registered non-profit organization.  (Its <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/info/about/contact" title="BioMed Central &#039;Contact us&#039; page">contact page</a> says BioMed Central Ltd is "a company registered in England and Wales with Company Number 3680030 [...] and having VAT number GB 4662477 23.")  In its <abbr title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</abbr> page "<a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/info/about/faq?name=revenue" title="BioMed Central Frequently Asked Questions page on revenue">How does BioMed Central make money?</a>" BMC describes revenue-generating possibilities:</p>
<blockquote><p>As a publisher, BioMed Central obviously has to be profitable to survive as a service for the biomedical community. We believe that if we add value to raw data, we are entitled to charge for access to it. If a journal commissions topical or thematic reviews, and so helps individuals orientate themselves amidst the complexity of available research, it may have a subscription charge. Furthermore, if we construct and maintain community alerting services, allowing users to discover where, in the eyes of their peers, quality and significance lie, we will charge. An example of such product is Faculty of 1000. We are also carrying advertising on our site, and we will be creating other products and services for which a charge will be made.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think it is safe to say that BMC is well within the relm of what can be characterized as a "business."</p>
<h2>Compared to PLoS</h2>
<p>Another larger player in the open access publishing arena is the Public Library of Science (PLoS), and it serves as a good point of comparison.  Number six of <a href="http://www.plos.org/about/plos/core-principles/" title="Public Library of Science: Core Principles">its nine core principles</a> is labeled "Financial fairness":</p>
<blockquote><p>As a nonprofit organization, PLoS charges authors a fair price that reflects the actual cost of publication. However, the ability of authors to pay publication charges will never be a consideration in the decision whether to publish.</p></blockquote>
<p>In contrast to BMC, PLoS is a 501(c)(3) Public Charity under the U.S. <abbr title="Internal Revenue Service">IRS</abbr> tax code.  As a consequence it files <a href="http://www.guidestar.org/FinDocuments/2006/680/492/2006-680492065-02cc2b4b-9.pdf" title="IRS Form 990 statement from PLoS for 2006">an IRS form 990</a> that allows us to see the details of its operation and gauge whether there is an undue burden on revenues based on expenses.  PLoS lists ways to <a href="http://www.plos.org/support/" title="Public Library of Science: Support PLoS">contribute to its effort</a>, including individual contributions and institutional membership/sponsorship.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>In my own mind, I had equated "open access" with "not-for-profit" -- and in the case of BMC this is not the case.  I had thought that open access was universally like PLoS' model.  Just to be clear about this, I'm not saying that academic values are good and business values are bad.  I am saying that we should not expect businesses to act based on the values that drive academic institutions and that we shouldn't be surprised when businesses behave like businesses.  I was surprised to learn that BMC is a business.</p>
<p>Perhaps BMC is ultimately a "better" model.  Does the revenue from advertising and direct marketing to registered users ultimately drive down the cost of per-article publishing?  Do the subscription (pay-for) services offered by BMC not interfere with access to the underlying article data?  (<strike>Here's a good question:  can one take the open access article data from BMC and construct competing value-added services?  Based on reading point #8 in <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/info/about/tandc" title="BioMed Central Terms and Conditions">BMC's Terms and Conditions</a>, it would appear not.</strike> Update 20070815T0907:  The answer to this question is yes, one can.  See the <a href="/article/what-is-biomed-central/#comment-20548">first comment by Matt Cockerill</a>, followed by <a href="/article/what-is-biomed-central/#comment-20563">my reply</a> and <a href="/article/what-is-biomed-central/#comment-20704">Matt's announcement of changes to the Terms and Conditions page</a> that, to my reading, makes points eight and nine of BioMed Central's Terms and Conditions much clearer.)  These are all questions to be answered as the open access model evolves.</p>
<p>I would be curious to learn in the comments if others thought that "open access" equated to "not-for-profit".  It is entirely possible that I'm the only one, in which case this jester just made a fool of himself.</p>
