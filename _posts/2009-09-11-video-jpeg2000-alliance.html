  content: "You questioned the term IBC &ndash; which is an acronym for an annual
    tradeshow held in Hamburg Germany. IBC stands for &lsquo;International Broadcasters
    Convention&rsquo;. As a leader in the broadcast communications industry, Fast
    Forward Video attends every year and was involved in spearheading the JPEG2000
    Alliance at IBC in 2009. \r\n\r\nThe alliance is a consortium of companies interested
    in promoting the many advantages of using JPEG2000 for cinematographers, broadcast
    media, and high end surveillance companies that require the highest image quality
    available today. Although a fairly new undertaking, you can find out more about
    the JPEG2000 Alliance at www.jpeg2000alliance.com."

  content: Thank you for the additional details, Barbara.  I'm not as familiar with
    the Motion JPEG2000 part of the JPEG2000 standard, but I'm happy to see an industry
    consortium stepping up to promote the standard.  That can certainly help us in
    the cultural heritage community with our access and preservation challenges.

<p>Today at <a href="http://www.ibc.org/page.cfm/Link=122/t=m/goSection=5" title="IBC2009 - Conference Programme">IBC2009</a> <a href="http://www.ffv.com/" title="Fast Forward Video Homepage" rel="homepage">Fast Forward Video</a> (FFV) <a href="http://fastforwardvideo.wordpress.com/2009/09/04/fast-forward-video-launches-jpeg2000-alliance/" title="Fast Forward Video Launches JPEG2000 Alliance">announced</a> the launch of the JPEG2000 Alliance, "a consortium of broadcast industry leaders dedicated to ensuring that JPEG2000 continues to develop into a leading compression standard."  According to the <a href="http://fastforwardvideo.wordpress.com/2009/09/04/fast-forward-video-launches-jpeg2000-alliance/" title="Fast Forward Video Launches JPEG2000 Alliance">press release</a>:<br />
<blockquote>In addition to developing their own JPEG2000 technologies and products, these companies will collaborate to ensure widespread acceptance, deployment, and support of the compression standard for the benefit of the media and video industries. Activities will be centered on educating and creating awareness about the benefits of JPEG2000, promoting interoperability between standards and system devices, and promoting the development of tools by members and industry peers.</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition to FFV, charter members of the JPEG2000 Alliance include 360 Systems, Analog Devices, Barco, Digital Rapids, Doremi Labs, the Fraunhofer Institute, Front Porch Digital, intoPIX, Media Links, Media Matters and Miranda Technologies.  I'm taking the time to post this (and I'm hoping you are taking the time to read it) to give a sense of how JPEG2000 is being used outside the cultural heritage community.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what "IBC" stands for (their website doesn't expand the acronym), but according to their <a href="http://www.ibc.org/page.cfm/Link=7/t=m" title="About IBC and its partners">"about" page</a> they are "the leading international forum for the electronic media industry."  Based on the nature of the six partners behind the IBC (<a href="http://www.theiabm.org/" rel="homepage" title="IABM - representing broadcast &amp; media technology suppliers worldwide">International Association of Broadcasting Manufacturers</a>, <a href="http://www.theiet.org/" rel="homepage" title="The Institution of Engineering and Technology - The IET">Institution of Engineering and Technology</a>, <a href="http://www.ieee.org/bts" rel="homepage" title="IEEE Broadcast Technology Society">IEEE Broadcast Technology Society</a>, <a href="http://www.rts.org.uk/" rel="homepage" title="Royal Television Society">Royal Television Society</a>, <a href="http://www.scte.org.uk/" rel="homepage" title="SCTE - The Society for Broadband Professionals">Society of Cable Telecommunication Engineers</a>, and <a href="http://www.smpte.org/" rel="homepage" title="Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers">Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers</a>), it seems to be geared towards broadcast media.  There is a conference going now in Amsterdam where they expect to have over 49,000 attendees and 1,300 exhibitors.</p>
