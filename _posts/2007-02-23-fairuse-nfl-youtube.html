<p>Here is something to keep an eye on.  Via the <a href="http://chronicle.com/wiredcampus/article/1881/fighting-youtube-for-fair-use" title="The Chronicle: Wired Campus Blog: Fighting YouTube for &amp;#39;Fair Use&amp;#39;">Chronicle of Higher Education</a>, <a href="http://wendy.seltzer.org/wendy.html" title="Wendy Seltzer">Wendy Seltzer</a>, a visiting assistant professor at Brooklyn Law School and Fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard Law School, is demonstrating the concept of fair use to her class by going head-to-head with the National Football League.  Specifically, <a href="http://wendy.seltzer.org/blog/archives/2007/02/08/my_first_youtube_super_bowl_highlights_or_lowlights.html" title="Wendy&#039;s Blog: Legal Tags: My First YouTube: Super Bowl Highlights or Lowlights">she posted a 30 second video snippet of the NFL's standard copyright statement</a> to YouTube on February 8th and waited to see what would happen.</p>
<p>As could be expected, Seltzer <a href="http://wendy.seltzer.org/blog/archives/2007/02/13/my_first_dmca_takedown.html" title="">received a DMCA takedown notice</a> five days later and the content is no longer viewable on YouTube.  In response, she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070223000000/http://wendy.seltzer.org:80/blog/dmca-nfl#000437" title="Wendy&#039;s Blog: Legal Tags: DMCA Saga Act II: Counter-Notification">sent a counter notification</a> exerting fair use rights to use the excerpt as an example of overreaching copyright warnings.  (Getting dizzy from all of the claims and counter claims yet?)</p>
<p>So the ball is back in YouTube's court as they are stuck in the middle between Prof. Seltzer on the one side and the NFL on the other.  Check out the comments to the three above postings for a real interesting take on what has happened so far and keep an eye on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4uC2H10uIo" title="">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4uC2H10uIo</a> to see what happens early next month.</p>
<p>[Update on 14-Mar-2006:  The <a href="http://chronicle.com/wiredcampus/article/1930/a-professor-attempts-a-goal-line-stand" title="The Chronicle: Wired Campus Blog: A Professor Attempts a Goal-Line Stand">Chronicle of Higher Education has an update</a> describing how the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070223000000/http://wendy.seltzer.org:80/blog/dmca-nfl#000441" title="http://wendy.seltzer.org/blog/archives/2007/03/06/we_have_putback_super_bowl_warnings_back_online.html">content was put back</a> but, at this point in time, is now unavailable again.  No word yet about why the content was pulled back a second time.]</p>
