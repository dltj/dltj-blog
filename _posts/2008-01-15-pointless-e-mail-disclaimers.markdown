    "This email and any attachment(s) is intended for and confidential to the addressee.
    If you are neither the addressee nor an authorised recipient for the add") and
    read this post -- which it would seem you did -- and didn't like what your read
    -- which it would seem you didn't -- I'm glad you felt better in the end by taking
    the time to let me know exactly how pointless you thought the whole exercise was.  Szervusz!

    to say that I was indeed entertained by the article - I'd been googling pointless
    disclaimers and am trying to find out if they've ever been used in court successfully
    (purely because they annoy me so much). cheers!

    stole that stupid disclaimer from someone or they drafted it themselves. What
    I found was this blog with a heap of stupid disclaimers. I still don't see the
    point in collecting them, but yeah, you're right, I'm still here posting another
    comment, which is sort of entertaining. Maybe I'll finally get to like the site...

    (admittedly a long time running diversion) from more interesting matters discussed
    here: namely, the impact of technology on libraries.  Although I'm pretty close
    to the topic itself, I'd venture to say most would find it more interesting than
    e-mail disclaimers.\r\n\r\nThanks for stopping by, Scott, and for your comment.
    \ I don't know if these disclaimers have ever been tested in court, but they do
    seem very close to the \"shrink-wrap licenses\" that have been invalid in many
    U.S. courts."

    may draw a similarity here with a Fax I received from Barclays Investments in

    was sent a cheque.....do you think that this activity would get rid of these stupid

  content: John -- I am not a lawyer, and certainly not experienced in U.K. or Australian
    law.  That said, I don't think these sorts of statements are enforcable.  The
    problem is that, as a "contract" of sorts, you were not given the opportunity
    to challenge or reject it before you received the e-mail message.  I tend to view
    them as a courtesy -- if an unnecessary and sometimes annoying one -- and just
    ignore them.  Except for these, of course, which were just too humorous to ignore.

I've been collecting disclaimers that appear on the bottom of e-mail messages in a draft post on <acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester">_DLTJ_</acronym> for about a year now -- every time I'd get a new one with a different twist, I'd save it anticipating the day would come that there would be enough humor here to share with the rest of you.  That day has come.  There wasn't one that disclaimer that finally pushed the publication of this post over the edge; just the accumulation of examples.  Identifying information has been removed, but the humor was left intact.  If you recognize your institution/company in these examples, please laugh along with me.  If you are the lawyer or pseudo-lawyer that drafted these, please do us all a favor and find something else to work on.  Like drafting disclaimers for toothpicks and such.

## An Institution By Any Other Name is Just a Number
This educational institution felt the need not only to identify itself by name several times, but also include four specific numeric identifiers for itself.
> YOU MUST READ THIS NOTICE  _[And you must do so while suppressing any giggling about it.]_<br />
This email has been sent by _institution_ (_institution's random numeric identifier_). This email (and any attachment) is confidential and is intended for the use of the addressee(s) only. If you are not the intended recipient of this email you must not copy, distribute, take any action in reliance on it or disclose it to anyone. Any confidentiality is not waived or lost by reason of mistaken delivery to you. The views expressed in this email are not necessarily those of _institution_. It is very important that before opening any attachments to this email you check them for viruses and defects. _institution_ does not accept liability for any corruption or viruses or any consequence which arise as a result of this email transmission. Email communications with _institution_ may be subject to automated email filtering, which could result in the delay or deletion of a legitimate email before it is read by its intended recipient at _institution_. Please tell us if you have concerns about this automatic filtering. The Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS) Provider Number is _another numeric identifier_ (_institution branch_), _yet another random numeric identifier_ (_institution branch_), and _a final numeric identifier_ (_institution branch_) for _institution_.

I don't have concerns about the automatic filtering, just the automatic insertion of needless disclaimers.  Which brings us to...

## Disclaimers as a Form of Spam?
> CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE AND DISCLAIMER
> 
> Information in this transmission is intended only for the person(s) to whom it is addressed and may contain privileged and/or confidential information. If you are not the intended recipient, any disclosure, copying or dissemination of the information is unauthorised and you should delete/destroy all copies and notify the sender. No liability is accepted for any unauthorised use of the information contained in this transmission.
>
> This disclaimer has been automatically added.

So the disclaimer was automatically added.  Thank goodness for that, because I can't imagine having to copy and paste needless disclaimers into every e-mail that I sent.  But does the fact that it was automatically sent to me make it a form of spam?  Hmmm -- maybe there is a market for software that automatically removes disclaimers from e-mail messages.

## Speaking of Spam
> The information in this email is confidential, and intended solely for the Addressee. If you have erroneously received this message, please delete it immediately and notify the sender. Any copying or further distribution beyond the original addressee is not intended, and may be unlawful.

This one arrived in a spam message sent to me.  I decided to risk breaking the law by posting this portion of the message in a public forum.

## Have Your Agents Talk To My Agents
> DISCLAIMER: This e-mail is confidential and should not be used by anyone who is not the original intended recipient. If you have received this e-mail in error please inform the sender and delete it from your mailbox or any other storage mechanism. Neither _company_ nor any of its agents accept liability for any statements made which are clearly the sender's own and not expressly made on behalf of _company_ or one of its agents. Please note that neither _company_ nor any of its agents accept any responsibility for viruses that may be contained in this e-mail or its attachments and it is your responsibility to scan the e-mail and attachments (if any). No contracts may be concluded on behalf of _company_ or its agents by means of e-mail communication.  _Company_ in England and Wales with registered number _company's random number_ Registered Office _company's address_.

I wish I had agents who would act on my behalf that would read through this gobblety-gook so I wouldn't have to read through the message and decide if I may or may not be entering into some sort of contract by reading the message.

## You are hereby informally notified that I could care less about your disclaimer
> This communication is for use by the intended recipient and contains information that may be Privileged, confidential or copyrighted under applicable law. If you are not the intended recipient, you are hereby formally notified that any use, copying or distribution of this e-mail, in whole or in part, is strictly prohibited. Please notify the sender by return e-mail and delete this e-mail from your system. Unless explicitly and conspicuously designated as "E-Contract Intended", this e-mail does not constitute a contract offer, a contract amendment, or an acceptance of a contract offer. This e-mail does not constitute a consent to the use of sender's contact information for direct marketing purposes or for transfers of data to third parties.

Can I imply the inverse of the sentence that begins, "If you are not the intended recipient..."?  That is to say, if I am the intended recipient, that I can use, copy and distribute the e-mail in any way that I see fit?

## Caveats:  Humorless
In messages from us.army.mil,

This one came in a message posted to a mailing list that contained exactly five lines of real content -- line 1: greeting, line 2: blank, line 3: a quick question, line 4: blank, line 5: author's name.  Talk about a bad signal to noise ratio!

## No Bogosity [^1] Here!

By reading this email, you agree, on behalf of your employer, to release me from all obligations and waivers arising from any and all NON-NEGOTIATED agreements, licenses, terms-of-service, shrinkwrap, clickwrap, browsewrap, confidentiality, non-disclosure, non-compete and acceptable use policies ("BOGUS AGREEMENTS") that I have entered into with your employer, its partners, licensors, agents and assigns, in perpetuity, without prejudice to my ongoing rights and privileges. You further represent that you have the authority to release me from any BOGUS AGREEMENTS on behalf of your employer.

It is good to know that there are companies out there that are trying to stamp out needless b*llsh*t[^2].  But let me see if I got this straight -- by reading your message, I agree to release you from <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Bogus Agreements</span> because I am able to do so.  But what if I don't have that authority?  Should I not read your message?  Perhaps you should have told me that before I read it...

## Let the Lawyers Have the Last Say
And finally, there is this "****** disclaimer ******" (complete with unnecessary asterisks) that honestly had nothing to do with any kind of legal proposition, but a legal professional felt the need to insert the fact that no "legal professional privilege" should be implied by receipt and reading of the message.

So just to be sure, should I run the entire message past my legal counsel just to be sure they do not want to assert some sort of legal professional privilege on the correspondence?

Do you have a favorite legal disclaimer?  Let me know in the comments...

## December 2018 Addition: Angry Sibling Edition
So for the near-11-year anniversary for this post, I'm adding this one that I received from a DLTJ reader.
> This was actually sent to me by my brother, who hates me. So, now, in order for me not to forward his emails to my lawyer, he has placed this disclaimer at the bottom:

>> This is a private message between the sender and recipient only and information contained in or attached to this communication is privileged, confidential and intended only for the person or persons named. Any message being forwarded without the consent of the sender is in violation of the Governing Privacy Laws and will be prosecuted to the extent the Law will allow.    If you are not the intended recipient of this transmission, you are hereby notified that any dissemination, distribution or copying of this communication to anyone other than the intended recipient or recipients is strictly prohibited.  If you receive this communication in error, do not read it.  Please immediately reply to the sender that you have received this communication in error and then please delete this communication from your computer.  Thank you.

> I didn't see any of your disclaimers showing the second sentence, so I was wondering if it made it any more valid than the other ones. If not, well then you have one more to add to your list.

No, I haven't seen anything like this either.  Thanks for sending!

## November 2020 Addition: Not Pointless, More Hopeful
Nearing the 13th anniversary for this post, I saw an email disclaimer on Twitter that was too good to pass up.
It comes from Cory Doctorow [by way of _Ray [REDACTED]_](https://twitter.com/rayredacted/status/1324117810927276032).

> For avoidance of doubt: This email does not constitute permission to add me to your mailing list.
>
> READ CAREFULLY. By reading this email, you agree, on behalf of your employer, to release me from all obligations and waivers arising from any and all NON-NEGOTIATED agreements, licenses, terms-of-service, shrinkwrap, clickwrap, browsewrap, confidentiality, non-disclosure, non-compete and acceptable use policies ("BOGUS AGREEMENTS") that I have entered into with your employer, its partners, licensors, agents and assigns, in perpetuity, without prejudice to my ongoing rights and privileges. You further represent that you have the authority to release me from any BOGUS AGREEMENTS on behalf of your employer.
>
> As is the case with every email you've ever received, this email has not been scanned for all known viruses.

As I was typing it from the image in the tweet, I couldn't help but notice that Mr. Doctorow may not be a believer in the Oxford comma.
