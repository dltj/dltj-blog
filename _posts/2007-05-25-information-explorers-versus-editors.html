  content: "I still remember the 4th grade science assignment (1980) that I flunked
    because I could not find any information on the Virginia Rail.\r\n\r\nToday, all
    I would have to do is start at:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Rail\"

<p>A post by Bill Harris at "Dubious Quality" with the title <a href="http://dubiousquality.blogspot.com/2007/05/information.html" title="Dubious Quality: Information">Information</a> got caught up in my <a href="http://www.technorati.com/watchlists/rss.html?wid=393622" title="RSS Feed for Disruptive Change in Libraries">Technorati filter</a> for <span class="removed_link" title="http://technorati.com/search/%26quot%3Bdisruptive+change%26quot%3B+AND+%28libraries+OR+library%29">disruptive change in libraries</span>.  Geoff Engelstein, a colleague of Bill's mentioned this in an e-mail:</p>
<blockquote><p>We were a generation of information explorers. They [Geoff's thirteen&ndash; and eleven-year-olds] are a generation of editors.</p></blockquote>
<p>The context is a reflection on Bill's part of the trials and feelings of success when conducting research:  "you'd have to pull out a rack in the card catalog according to the alphabetized subject and flip through the cards. If you got lucky, the title of a book or a brief description would point you in the right direction. Then you had to actually find the book, skim through it, and hope that you'd find some information."  Bill even includes a link to <a href="http://www.usg.edu/galileo/skills/unit04/primer04_04.phtml" title="What is an online library catalog?">a bibliographic instruction page <em>showing</em> how an actual card catalog works</a>.</p>
<p>Geoff's observation is that "the big skill [his kids] are learning is what information to dump and what to keep" &mdash; hence the comparison to the work of an editor.</p>
<p>This has to get one thinking &mdash; are the services we are building for the information explorers or the information editors?</p>
