My panel group met by conference call this afternoon to discuss the topic, and I came away feeling great about the synergy of this group.  The panel style is the panelists responding to a question from the moderator and reactions from each other with time for questions from the audience.  No canned presentations!</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://connect.ala.org/user/68988" title="Bohyun Kim | ALA Connect">Bohyun Kim</a> from Florida International University for setting up the panel discussion.</p>
