  content: At the info desk at OR2007, they are suggesting the tag "or2007". I've
    tagged a grand total of one site in del.icio.us that way so far. Any reason to
    go with this other tag instead?

    the 'or2007' tag to the <span class=\"removed_link\" title=\"http://hitchhikr.com/index.php?conf_id=75\">HitchHikr
    listing for this conference</span>, so you can see the cruft that comes in when
    adding that.  Interesting enough, if one does <span class=\"removed_link\" title=\"http://www.technorati.com/tag/or2007\">a
    search for 'or2007' on Technorati itself</span>, the cruft is not there.  Since
    HitchHikr proportedly uses Technorati, I'm not sure where it is coming from.\r\n\r\nHitchHikr
    only looks at blog postings and Flikr, so it won't pick up the Del.Icio.Us postings.<p

<p>Are you blogging the <a href="http://openrepositories.org/" title="Open Repositories 2007">Open Repositories</a> conference in San Antonio this week?  Are you posting pictures to Flickr?</p>
<p>if so, may I suggest using the 'icor2007' tag when posting your content.  When doing so, the <span class="removed_link" title="http://hitchhikr.com/index.php?conf_id=75">HitchHikr service will aggregate content from Technorati and Flickr</span> based on that tag.  (Why not simply "or2007"? -- it looks like that tag picks up extra cruft in a non LATIN-1 character set.)
