<p>Word of this <a href="http://confluence.media.berkeley.edu/confluence/display/BSPI/Project+Definition">Fedora-based image collection tool</a> comes from the <a href="http://collab.sakaiproject.org/portal/site/1085757835236-8664/page/1087931006050-11438">Sakai Library &amp; Repositiories discussion group</a> [Sakai Collab account required].</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Project Name &amp; Description (Short)</h3>
<p><em>bSpace Images Version 1.0</em><br />
The initial version of bSpace Images will focus on personal collections and provide "baseline" functionality found in existing tools like Course Gallery, ARTstor, Luna Insight, Portfolio, and Spiro. Through a user centered design process, bSpace Images features will be driven by faculty observations and interviews. Unlike the other campus offerings, its interface design will be based on the faculty's real needs.</p>
<p>Version 1.0 will consist of 4 phases: "Personal Collection Migration"; "Find, Browse, Organize Collection"; "Course/Lecture Galleries"; "Image Ingest from Personal Computer". This <a href="http://confluence.media.berkeley.edu/confluence/display/BSPI/bSpace+Images+Version+1.0" title="bSpace Images Version 1.0">diagram</a> provides a list of proposed features for each phase.</p>

They have a nice vision for the integration of a library repository with a collaboration and learning environment.  This is definitely something we should watch and see if portions can be applied to the DRC project.</p>
