    You could log the desire to have "Directions links" as a feature
    request here: http://code.google.com/p/gmaps-api-issues/issues/list
    I don't think every developer would want it, so it'd probably have
    to be enabled through an option.

  content: Thanks, Pamela -- <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gmaps-api-issues/issues/detail?id=75"
    rel="nofollow">I've submitted the request</a>.  It won't help for the conference
    this weekend, but it would be useful (if Google adopts the suggestion) for similar
    maps at future meetings...

<p>Here is a map of official conference hotels and a link to download the KML file into Google Earth.<br />
<a href="http://dltj.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/ALA-MW-2008.kml">ALA Midwinter 2008 Hotel KML Location file</a></p>
<p>I'm somewhat disappointed by the display of the KML file through the Google Maps API.  The KML file contains<br />
<address> tags, which in the <a href="http://earth.google.com/download-earth.html" title="Download Google Earth application">Google Earth desktop application</a> appears to enable the "Directions From" and "Directions To" options.  It is entirely possible that I'm missing something in the KML file -- it was created by exporting a folder of placemarks from the Google Earth application.  The raw KML file, suitable for importing into Google Earth, can be downloaded from the link under the map.</p>
<p>If you have any suggestions for improving the output, let me know.</p>
