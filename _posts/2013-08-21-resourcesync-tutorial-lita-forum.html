<p><a href="http://www.openarchives.org/rs" title="ResourceSync Framework Specification"><img src="http://dltj.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/resync_logo.jpg" width="77" height="70" alt="ResourceSync Logo" class="alignright" /></a>As you are planning your trip to the <a href="http://www.ala.org/lita/conferences/forum/2013" title="2013 LITA Forum | Library Information Technology Association (LITA)">2013 LITA Forum</a> in Louisville in mid-November, plan to stay a few hours longer to attend the <a href="http://www.ala.org/lita/conferences/forum/2013/postcon" title="2013 Forum: Post-conference | Library Information Technology Association (LITA)">ResourceSync Tutorial</a> happening after the close of the main conference on Sunday.  <a href="http://public.lanl.gov/herbertv/home/" title="Herbert Van de Sompel homepage">Herbert van de Sompel</a> will lead this 3-hour session where attendees can learn about how the emerging <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/rs" title="ResourceSync homepage">ResourceSync</a> standard can be used to synchronize web resources between servers.  There is no cost to attend the post-conference tutorial, but we would appreciate knowing how many people are coming.  Please select the post conference checkbox on the registration form to let us know.</p>
<p>On a related note, <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/rs/0.9.1/toc" title="ResourceSync Framework Specification - version 0.9.1 - Table of Contents">version 0.9.1 of the ResourceSync Framework Specification</a> was published today.  We are encouraging final feedback to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/resourcesync">ResourceSync Google Group</a> as the editing wraps up and the specification begins the formal NISO voting process.</p>
<p>Thanks go out to the LITA headquarters staff for helping with the post-conference local arrangements.</p>
