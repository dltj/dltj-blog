title: "Mastodon Instance Operators Report on the Impact of the #TwitterMigration"

A number of Mastodon operators have started to report the impact of the #TwitterMigration on their instances. 
I started gathering these because I was curious about what it takes to run a public or semi-public Mastodon instance. 
These reports are full of those kinds of details, but they also describe evolutions of policy and operations that are just as interesting. 
If you see other reports (or have posted a report of your own Mastodon instance), please tag me at [@dltj@code4lib.social](https://code4lib.social/@dltj) and I'll add it to this list.

Less than 72 hours after being excited for hitting 100 users we hit 10,000 users.'

As of writing this, we are one of the biggest and most active instances on the fediverse and one of the oldest mastodon instances, starting mid of April 2017. For the last 5 years everything was simple, one VM with 10 cores, 500GB NVMe SSD Storage and 32GB RAM. This VM did everything from the database to the webserving. Then Musk happened.'

blockquote='The steep line itself is when I realised that doing it that way actually gave us less control over new user numbers, so we went back to &lsquo;anyone can request an account but accounts need to be approved by a mod&rsquo;. This was about the time that big news sites had started reporting people were leaving Twitter for Mastodon, and they were all linking to joinmastodon.org, where we were one of three art instances listed and the biggest one by far... We had 2000 new user accounts placed in the approval queue that day. These weren&lsquo;t approved accounts, so they weren&lsquo;t logged on and using .art - so they weren&lsquo;t contributing much (aside from the verification emails being sent out) to server activity. Still, server activity skyrocketed.'

blockquote='If you haven&lsquo;t heard, Elon Musk recently agreed a deal to buy Twitter for a whopping $44bn. That cause a little turmoil over in Twitter land, which resulted in expats coming over to Mastodon in their droves. Because we&lsquo;re one of the biggest technology focussed instances on the Fediverse, a lot of people requested an account on Fosstodon. As you can see from the graphs below, the spike in users from Twitter made our usual activity almost flat line. This effectively resulted in a sustained DDoS that lasted for around 36 hours. As you can imagine, that was a lot of fun for myself and the team. Here&lsquo;s the details of what happened during those 36 hoursâ€¦'
