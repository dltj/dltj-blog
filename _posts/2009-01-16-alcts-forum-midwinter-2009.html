<div id="hcalendar-ALCTS-Forum" class="vevent">Community-shared metadata has certainly been a <a href="http://wiki.code4lib.org/index.php/OCLC_Policy_Change" title="OCLC Policy Change discussion">hot topic</a> of late.  It is timely, then that ALCTS is sponsoring <span class="description">a panel discussion about sharing library-created data inside and outside the library community</span> at the upcoming ALA Midwinter meeting in Denver.  From the panel description:<br />
<blockquote>Panelists will share a variety of perspectives on community norms, policies, and best practices for accessing, using, and sharing the data that supports the discovery and delivery of library collections. What can libraries and the organizations that serve them learn from the open data movement and sites like Wikipedia? What principles and practices for shared data creation and maintenance will most help and strengthen libraries in the future? Panelists will also be addressing the changes in the OCLC Record Use Policy, particularly in light of the <a href="http://www.oclc.org/us/en/news/releases/20092.htm" title="Review Board on Shared Records [OCLC]">recent announcement</a> from OCLC on the establishment of the Review Board of Shared Data Creation and Stewardship.</p></blockquote>
