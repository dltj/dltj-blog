  content: Projects like Alliance Digital Repository (ADR) encourage the use of open
    source software which ensures that the best quality software is easily accessible
    to the majority of the educated masses. I strongly believe that application of
    knowledge should be done more to help the larger community and less for profits.
    The ADR project is a major step in achieving that milestone.

  content: Thank you for your comment, "denver criminal lawyer", although I think
    that open source software is also good for the 'uneducated masses' as well.  Also,
    please pardon me if I offend you by removing the URL to your personal injury practice
    site (which was w w w . f l e s c h l a w . c o m -- in case anyone else was interested).  While
    I applaud your support of open source software -- which I believe to be sincere
    because you are, after all, an honest lawyer and wouldn't resort to link-bating
    tactics for a little extra Google juice -- I prefer to keep a respectable distance
    between <acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester"><i>DLTJ</i></acronym>
    and the legal profession.  I'm sure you understand.

<p>On Friday, the Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries <a href="http://www.coalliance.org/index.php?option=com_content&#038;task=view&#038;id=187&#038;Itemid=103" title="Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries">announced the creation of a consortium-wide digital repository project</a> similar to that of the <a href="http://info.drc.ohiolink.edu/" title="403 Forbidden">Ohio Digital Resource Commons</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Colorado Alliance Digital Repository Project Approved</h2>
<p><em>The Board of Directors of the Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries has approved initial funding for a consortium-wide digital repository project at its October 19, 2006 meeting.</em></p>
<p>The Board of Directors of the Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries has approved initial funding for a consortium-wide digital repository project at its October 19, 2006 meeting.  The project will use the Fedora open source software which was selected after a long evaluation process by the Institutional Repository Implementation Team, chaired by John Culshaw from the University of Colorado at Boulder.</p>
<p>The Alliance Digital Repository (ADR) project allows the participating member libraries to develop a shared technical and development infrastructure to store, preserve and disseminate a whole variety of digital objects including images, text, audio, video, learning objects, data sets or any other kind of material.  The project will make use of open source tools developed by others in order to fast track functionality.  As new software is developed as part of the project it will also be made available to the open source community.</p>
