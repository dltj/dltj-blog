<p>The conference organizers for <abbr title="2nd Workshop on Sustainable Software for Science: Practice and Experiences">WSSSPE2</abbr> have posted the <a href="http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe2/accepted-papers/" title="2nd Workshop on Sustainable Software for Science: Practice and Experiences (WSSSPE2) Accepted Papers | Working towards Sustainable Software for Science: Practice and Experiences">list of accepted papers</a> and the <a href="http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/wssspe2/travel-support/" title="2nd Workshop on Sustainable Software for Science: Practice and Experiences (WSSSPE2) Travel Support | Working towards Sustainable Software for Science: Practice and Experiences">application for travel support</a>.  I was on the program committee for this year's conference, and I can point to some papers that I think are particularly useful to libraries and the cultural heritage community in general:</p>
<ul>
<li>Michael R. Crusoe and C.Titus Brown. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1112541" title="Handle Redirect">Channeling community contributions to scientific software: a hackathon experience</a></li>
<li>James Howison. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1111632" title="Handle Redirect">Retract bit-rotten publications: Aligning incentives for sustaining scientific software</a></li>
<li>Marian Petre and Greg Wilson. <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.5648" title="403 Forbidden">Code Review For and By Scientists</a></li>
<li>Jory Schossau and Greg Wilson. <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.6220" title="403 Forbidden">Which Sustainable Software Practices Do Scientists Find Most Useful?</a></li>
