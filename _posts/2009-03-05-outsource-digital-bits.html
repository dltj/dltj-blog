  content: I know of a small archives that's doing all their backups on Mozy.  Simple,
    convenient, relatively idiot-proof, and with the small amount of material they
    currently need backed up, free.

  content: Thanks, Melissa.  I hadn't considered <a href="https://mozy.com/" rel="nofollow">Mozy</a>
    as a preservation solution.  (I had always put it strictly in the "backup" category.)  It
    would be worth taking a look at the terms-of-service to see what they guarantee.

  content: That's a good point; I'll direct them to the TOS and see if they've considered
    everything.  It does seem to be satisfying them, though.

  content: Robin -- thanks for checking into that.  Those terms are quite different
    from Amazon's S3 <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/agreement/#3" rel="nofollow">Term,
    Termination and Suspension</a> provisions.  At least with S3 there is some allowance
    for getting the data back out again, albeit with conditions of its own.

<p>A colleague forwarded <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/03/04/iron_mountain_cloud_filestore/" title="Iron Mountain punts subterranean data storage (The Register)">an article from <i>The Register</i></a> with news of a new service from Iron Mountain for <a href="http://www.ironmountain.com/news/2009/impr02232009.asp" title="Iron Mountain Digital Introduces the Industry's First Enterprise Solution for Cloud-Based File Archiving">Cloud-Based File Archiving</a>.  It is billed as a "storage archiving service designed to help companies reduce costs of storing and managing static data files."  My place of work is facing an increasing need large-scale digital preservation storage with the acquisition of a large collection of music and the conversion of our educational videos from physical DVD preservation to digital preservation.  We're talking terabytes of content that is we need to keep in its archival form -- uncompressed, high quality media files (not the lower quality, derivatives for day-to-day access).  It doesn't make sense to keep that on expensive SAN storage, of course, so this article struck me at just the right time to consider alternatives.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_801" align="alignnone" width="779" caption="Architecture Diagram for Iron Mountain\'s Virtual File Store service, showing the placement of the Virtual File Store appliance relative to other assets on the data center network.  Graphic from product datasheet (http://www.ironmountain.com/resources/vfs/virtual_file_store_datasheet.pdf)"]<img src="http://dltj.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/virtual-file-store-architecture.png" alt="Architecture Diagram for Iron Mountain&#039;s Virtual File Store service, showing the placement of the Virtual File Store appliance relative to other assets on the data center network" title="Virtual File Store Architecture" width="779" height="644" class="size-full wp-image-801" />[/caption]</p>
<p>According to the product literature, the service works by putting a black box on your network where one can drop files via CIFS or NFS.  The black box transfers the files over the internet to two Iron Mountain data centers.  Files can then be retrieved via an on-line on-demand service or by exchanging physical media with Iron Mountain for bulk retrieval needs.</p>
<p>We know, of course, that digital preservation is more than just preserving the digital bits:  it is the intellectual exercise of describing the stored information, the effort of maintaining an accurate catalog of that information, and the burden of migrating file formats or emulating platforms to read old file formats.  Handling the raw bits is a big deal, too -- checksumming to ensure unaltered status, refreshing files to new storage media, and protection from physical disasters.  This Iron Mountain solution seems to address this more mechanical portion of digital preservation, and it one that probably can benefit from aggregating the service needs of many customers (and so is ripe for outsourcing).</p>
<p>Is anyone doing something similar with their physical preservation of digital media?  Are there other companies that do the same thing?  (I know of <a href="http://www.oclc.org/us/en/digitalarchive/" title="OCLC Digital Archive product page">OCLC's Digital Archive service</a> &mdash; I did a <a href="http://dltj.org/article/oclc-digital-archive-vs-amazon-s3/" title="Long-term Preservation Storage: OCLC Digital Archive versus Amazon S3">comparison of it with Amazon S3</a> last year.)</p>
