    social media Librarians to spread the word (the site is meant for docs).\r\n\r\n3.
    Knows images of NLM 5 stars will attract attention.\r\n\r\n4. Causes controversy
    with a tweet stating legal ramifications if a article is not removed (come on
    - Brit laws have no jurisdiction way over in Canada, even worse on the www).\r\n\r\n5.
    Everyones talking about them - hence traffic to their site.\r\n\r\n6. Low and
    behold the rogue contingent part company, and the project starts a fresh and free
    to target institutions, hospitals etc. to make docs aware.\r\n\r\n7. With good
    stats (traffic) can now attract pharma or higher paying adsense to advertise on
    the site which is actually quite good  for docs.\r\n\r\n8. The brainchild behind
    the events is a genius!"

  content: "Excellent summary.\r\n\r\nThe reason that @cschardt addressed @gabeboldt
    directly as well as @ClinicalReader can be found in this Google cache of http://clinicalreader.com/health_tweets.htm
    \ \r\n\r\nThe dubious endorsement was displayed in the \"twitter buzz\" section
    of that page (right side or bottom, depending on your browser) as a screenshot
    of a tweet by @gabeboldt retweeting @ClinicalReader announcing the endorsement.
    \ So any or all of the tweets or retweets involved may have disappeared or may
    never have existed at all.\r\n\r\nFinally, for Howel Taylor: permanently soiling
    one's brand with the stink of unethical behavior for the sake of AdSense revenue
    - especially on a website for doctors - seems akin to burning down one's house
    to stave off the chill of a cold winter night."

    -- I think you underestimate the bad publicity that has been generated by this
    incident.  The way that the 'clinicalreader' Twitter account has moved around
    it will be difficult to transfer those users back to the target service.  And
    anyone who was following the tweets at the time has to wonder about the viability
    of the company.  Of the first 10 hits on Google for \"clinical reader\", fully
    half of them at this point are not positive reviews of the service.  I could be
    wrong, but I don't see a real upside for the company.  Have other companies followed
    your path to success?\r\n\r\nLuke -- Thanks for the explanation between @cschardt
    and @gabedoldt.  Since the \"health tweets\" page is gong to a 404, I took a picture
    of it for posterity and <a href=\"http://twitpic.com/b2cma\" rel=\"nofollow\">uploaded

<p>As libraries feel the need to join the social media landscape to meet a segment of their user population already there, it is useful to step back and get acclimated.  There is a pace of information flow that is unlike anything else in the physical world, and a minor incident -- be it an ill-advised policy decision or an unfortunate slip of the tongue -- can quickly spiral out of your control.  And that is probably the key word:  <em>control</em>.  You don't, can't, and won't have it.  It isn't the nature of this media.  "Damage control," if you want to think of it like that, is honest, sincere, decisive, and quick communication with your users.  As a counter example, I offer the case of Clinical Reader.<br />
<!--more--><br />
<ins datetime="2009-07-23T02:00:24+00:00">(What follows in this post are the specific details of the Clinical Reader example.  If you are not interested in the specific details, you may want to start by reading the <a href="http://dltj.org/article/learning-from-clinical-reader/">observations and recommendations</a> post instead.)</ins></p>
<h2>The Backstory</h2>
<p>Clinical Reader started operations earlier this year as point of aggregation for medical information.  The <a href="http://clinicalreader.com/cr/about/" title="About page for Clinical Reader">service's about page</a> describes its "beginnings" this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>Clinical Reader was brought to life in 2009 by a junior doctor and a small group of forward thinking young tech programmers spread across London and Toronto. The conceptualized idea was to manage clinical information overload and deliver relevant news from an authoritative source on a daily basis.</p></blockquote>
<p>On the technical side, it is a website that syndicates content via RSS/Atom from various journals, news sources, blogs, and social media outlets.  There is the appearance of editorial decision making in the form of an "Editor's Choice" list (with no apparent description of how or why something makes this list), but mostly it seems to be a way to hide the complexity of syndicated content readers from those in the medical profession who could care less about such complexity.</p>
<p>Clinical Reader got some buzz, including <a href="http://list.uvm.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0907A&amp;L=MEDLIB-L&amp;T=0&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=42551" title="http://list.uvm.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0907A&amp;L=MEDLIB-L&amp;T=0&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=42551">a "Check out this site" message</a> from Medical Library Association president Connie Schardt (an endorsement of sorts that was <a href="http://list.uvm.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0907c&amp;L=MEDLIB-L&amp;D=0&amp;F=P&amp;P=8687&amp;F=" title="http://list.uvm.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0907c&amp;L=MEDLIB-L&amp;D=0&amp;F=P&amp;P=8687&amp;F=">retracted</a> two weeks later).</p>
<h2>The Spark of Controversy</h2>
<p>The controversy started when librarian Nicole Dettmar <a href="http://eagledawg.blogspot.com/2009/07/clinical-reader-starry-ethics-fail.html" title="http://eagledawg.blogspot.com/2009/07/clinical-reader-starry-ethics-fail.html">posted a message on her personal blog</a> questioning the apparent endorsement of the Clinical Reader service by the National Library of Medicine.  Ms. Dettmar is employed by the National Network of Libraries of Medicine <del datetime="2009-07-21T01:36:41+00:00">division</del> -- <ins datetime="2009-07-21T01:36:41+00:00">a program</ins> of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) -- although she makes is quite clear that her blog reflects her personal views.  From her vantage point, though, she knows that the NLM does not endorse commercial entities.  In her words:</p>
<blockquote><p>[caption id="starryethicsfail-image" align="alignright" width="171" caption="Graphic from Eagle Dawg Blog"]<a href="http://eagledawg.blogspot.com/2009/07/clinical-reader-starry-ethics-fail.html" title="http://eagledawg.blogspot.com/2009/07/clinical-reader-starry-ethics-fail.html"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ScwenD0KtCY/SlqqZr4AvxI/AAAAAAAAAUc/yS4PXJfruBY/s400/5starfail.JPG" alt="" width="171" height="172" style="border-bottom: 7px solid white;" border="0" /></a>[/caption]It is bogus as far as the National Library of Medicine (<a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/" title="National Library of Medicine - National Institutes of Health">NLM</a>) is concerned since the U.S. Government doesn't endorse or grant 5 stars to anything. The <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/copyright.html" title="NLM Copyright Information">NLM Copyright Information</a> page offers more elaboration, bold emphasis mine:
<div style="padding-left:2em"><strong style="font-weight: normal;">Endorsement:</strong> <span style="font-weight: bold;">NLM does not endorse or recommend any commercial products, processes, or services.</span> The <span style="font-weight: bold;">views and opinions of authors</span> expressed on NLM Web sites do not necessarily state or reflect those of the U.S. Government, and they <span style="font-weight: bold;">may not be used for advertising or product endorsement purposes.</span></div>
</blockquote>
<p>Ms. Dettmar also notes the use of two copyrighted, unattributed images:</p>
<blockquote><p>Clinical Reader also currently uses two copyrighted images on their <a href="http://clinicalreader.com/cr/partners/" title="Clinical Reader: Research articles, news and multimedia for doctors, all in one place">Partners</a> (<a href="http://www.bryanchristiedesign.com/search_display.php?illustration=586" title="Bryan Christie Design">specific original source</a>, copyright notice at bottom) and <a href="http://clinicalreader.com/cr/advertising/" title="Clinical Reader: Research articles, news and multimedia for doctors, all in one place">Advertising</a> pages (from somewhere on <a href="http://blog.signalnoise.com/" title="Signalnoise.com | The art of James White">Signalnoise</a>). A 'credit' link to a source doesn't honor an image copyright. Even free open source images, such as <a href="http://www.springerimages.com/search.aspx?free=true" title="SpringerImages - Search">this set of Springer Images</a>, are often limited to usage for <a href="http://scienceroll.com/2009/07/12/biomedical-images-for-presentations/" title="Biomedical Images for Presentations &amp;laquo; ScienceRoll">noncommerical purposes</a>. Commercial organizations can well afford to purchase or design their own graphics.</p></blockquote>

The first response from Clinical Reader came in the form of four Twitter messages from an account with the userid "ClinicalReader".  It is useful to note, I think, that the response came in the form of Twitter messages rather than a comment on Ms. Dettmar's blog post or in an e-mail message to her (her e-mail address is listed in her Blogspot profile).  This is the first indication that the representatives behind the ClinicalReader Twitter account are not necessarily up-to-speed with the common practices of social networking.  They brought the issue into Twitter when it didn't start there, and there were other, more long form, ways to communicate.  (It four tweets for ClinicalReader to get its initial points across.)  The many grammatical and spelling errors -- well beyond normal Twitter abbreviations and common constructs -- suggests that English may not be the primary language of the representatives.<br clear="all" /></p>

<p>Ms. Dettmar started a minute with replies later via Twitter that could be interfiled with the initial four tweets from ClinicalReader -- her first tweet at 11:40 in reply to the 11:36 ClinicalReader tweet, and her second tweet at 11:45 in reply to the 11:39 ClinicalReader tweet.<br clear="all" /></p>
<h2>Others Take Notice</h2>
<p>At this point others following Ms. Dettmar on Twitter start retweeting her response to the legal threat and an <i>ad hoc</i> community starts to form.  (Retweeting is the <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/04/16/retweet-guide/" title="http://mashable.com/2009/04/16/retweet-guide/">practice</a> of copying another user's tweet and pasting it into one of yours.  You credit the initial tweet by adding "RT" plus the originator's userid at the start of your tweet.)  Steve Lawson posted a <span class="removed_link" title="http://stevelawson.name/seealso/archives/2009/07/clinical_reader_from_zero_to_negative_sixty_with_one_bogus_threat.html">message on his blog</span> summarizing the controversy to that point in time.</p>

<p>Representatives behind the ClinicalReader account -- it becomes apparent soon that there are at least two people that have access to the Twitter account -- start to address some of the issues.  They address messages to those who are retweeting the earlier messages from Ms. Dettmar and Mr. Lawson.  (Oddly, they are not using the "reply" function of Twitter for reply messages and they show a tendency to retweet themselves, as demonstrated in the second to last message of this group.)  They are in contact with a Twitter user called 'signalnoiseart' about some of the unattributed graphics, and they report that they have permission to continue using them.  (There will be other allegations of use of unattributed graphics later in the week.)  And, lastly, they show and openness to communication -- and admirable trait under the circumstances. <br clear="all" /></p>

<p>Someone from the group of representatives using the ClinicalReader Twitter account takes the lead in responding to the issues by saying that he/she will start using his/her initials in messages; we'll refer to this person by those initials: AA.  (This is also evident in the change of client used to post messages into the Twitter stream from <a href="http://www.atebits.com/" title="atebits">Tweetie</a> to <a href="http://www.tweetdeck.com/" title="http://www.tweetdeck.com/">TweetDeck</a>, with AA apparently using TweetDeck exclusively.)  The fact that gender inclusive grammatical constructs are being used in describing this individual shows one of the remaining mysteries of this episode.  (The ClinicalReader Twitter account is later taken over by someone who identifies him-/herself as "Allan Marks" but even nearly a week later observers can't be sure of the identity of this person.)  AA indicates that the images showing endorsement will be removed from the Clinical Reader site, and gives an estimated time for when the changes will be apparent to internet users.  Indeed, a few hours later the graphics start to change to remove the implied endorsement of the National Library of Medicine.  Although AA indicates that he/she is the founder, AA then makes a classical leadership mistake of blaming a subordinate:  "We are keen to engage the twitter community the tweet made by a junior member of the team was poor judgment (AA)".</p>
<p>At the end of the first day, Luke Rosenberger (userid <a href="http://twitter.com/lukelibrarian" title="http://twitter.com/lukelibrarian">lukelibrarian</a>) notes what he sees as a discrepancy between Clinical Reader's desire to positively engage with librarians and language in the Clinical Reader newsletter.  Mr. Rosenberger <a href="http://twitter.com/lukelibrarian/status/2621386920" title="http://twitter.com/lukelibrarian/status/2621386920">tweets</a>, "good grief http://bit.ly/uniXw 'wave goodbye to the library journal shelf' and yet @clinicalreader wants love from librarians?!"  (The link, <span class="removed_link" title="http://bit.ly/uniXw">http://bit.ly/uniXw</span>, goes to the current newsletter on the Clinical Reader website; at the time this is being written, that web address is returning a "403 Error because this area is restricted" message.)  ClinicalReader responds: "@lukelibrarian Your browser is lagging behind says 'Make effective use of the library journal shelf' at http://bit.ly/uniXw" (this message has subsequently been deleted, but is recorded in the <a href="http://www.iterasi.net/openviewer.aspx?sqrlitid=k5wjssweauubhhau0aicsg" title="from:clinicalreader - Twitter Search 07/19">archive</a> of ClinicalReader tweets). Mr. Rosenberger <a href="http://twitter.com/lukelibrarian/status/2621558856" title="http://twitter.com/lukelibrarian/status/2621558856">responds</a>, "@ClinicalReader i see that you have removed 'wave goodbye' in the last few minutes. don't blame my browser, just admit your error. #fail"  The <acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester"><i>DLTJ</i></acronym> author noticed that a copy of the newsletter webpage was still in the Google search engine cache and <a href="http://twitpic.com/aa5hj" title="Cached version of http://clinicalreader.com/cr/latest_newslet... on Twitpic">created an image of the page</a>.<br clear="all" /></p>
<h2>Day Two:  One Step Forward, Two Steps Back</h2>
<p>Early in the second day Mr. Marks sent Ms. Dettmar an e-mail apology for the legal threats.  In <a href="http://docs.google.com/View?id=dfswb3bw_62df6hmcfh" title="Clinical Reader Apology July ...">his message</a>, which Ms. Dettmar subsequently posted to a public Google Docs document after receiving permission, Mr. Marks acknowledges that "the correct channels were not adhered to in seeking permission to use James White and Bryan Christie's images."  He also says that he understands the NLM policy and has "removed any suggestion of endorsement."  He goes on to say, "We have had support however from teams at Imperial College, the Guardian and the British Library where we have mutual connections."</p>

<p>At the end of the first day, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/">Guardian</a> <a href="http://www.badscience.net/" title="Bad Science">columnist</a> Ben Goldacre posted a <a href="http://twitter.com/bengoldacre/status/2625972015" title="http://twitter.com/bengoldacre/status/2625972015">tweet</a> warning users away from Clinical Reader.  On the second day of the incident, this would become one of the main focal points.  As Ms. Dettmar notes in a <a href="http://eagledawg.blogspot.com/2009/07/gratitude.html" title="Eagle Dawg Blog: Gratitude">follow up post</a>, one of the representatives behind the ClinicalReader Twitter account has been <a href="http://twitter.com/bengoldacre/statuses/2652470808" title="http://twitter.com/bengoldacre/statuses/2652470808">deleting tweets</a>, and so this conversation can't be pieced together in the typical way.  Ms. Dettmar, though, had been starting to save messages using a service called <a href="http://www.quoteurl.com/" title="QuoteURL - Share Twitter Conversations">QuoteURL</a>; QuoteURL "group[s] different Twitter updates from different people into a single page that has a permanent URL."  The thread of conversation between Mr. Goldacre and ClinicalReader is recorded in four QuoteURL aggregations: <a href="http://www.quoteurl.com/barex" title="BenGoldacre/ClinicalReader tweet aggregation #1">one</a>, <a href="http://www.quoteurl.com/ux5c6" title="BenGoldacre/ClinicalReader tweet aggregation #2">two</a>, <a href="http://www.quoteurl.com/ftnt7" title="BenGoldacre/ClinicalReader tweet aggregation #3">three</a>, and <a href="http://www.quoteurl.com/p3cse" title="BenGoldacre/ClinicalReader tweet aggregation #4">four</a>.  Mr. Goldacre asked several questions of ClinicalReader (not all of the responses are linked to in Twitter because the tweets have been deleted):</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><i><a href="http://twitter.com/bengoldacre/status/2637621417" title="http://twitter.com/bengoldacre/status/2637621417">BenGoldacre</a>: can you let me know in what way you are supported by the guardian, as your website claims?</i>:  Yes we attended a camp organised by Guardian when we we're developing our project , they provided excellent advice.

<li><i><a href="http://twitter.com/bengoldacre/status/2637715086" title="http://twitter.com/bengoldacre/status/2637715086">BenGoldacre</a>: so youre supported by the guardian in the sense that you went to an event they organised and some people gave you sm advice?; <a href="http://twitter.com/bengoldacre/status/2637755542" title="http://twitter.com/bengoldacre/status/2637755542">BenGoldacre</a>: so you're supported by the guardian in the sense that jemima might write about you at some stage in the future?</i>: bit more than that, I sense your still skeptical, but I kinda understand</li>
<li><i><a href="http://twitter.com/bengoldacre/status/2637791120" title="http://twitter.com/bengoldacre/status/2637791120">BenGoldacre</a>: that's great. i guess now i'm intrigued about your name.</i>: I'm sensible, the account belongs to the project Clinical Reader and not anyones personal opinion, lets email correspond <span class="removed_link" title="http://twitter.com/allan_marks/status/2637805815">(twitter)</span></li>
<li><i><a href="http://twitter.com/bengoldacre/status/2637796601" title="http://twitter.com/bengoldacre/status/2637796601">BenGoldacre</a>: maybe i like to know who's saying i got stuff wrong. and stuff. in the nicest way. maybe i want to sue you!</i>: See you're getting into the zone, so will quit while ahead</li>
<li><i><a href="http://twitter.com/bengoldacre/status/2638130749" title="http://twitter.com/bengoldacre/status/2638130749">BenGoldacre</a>: i think you need a reality check. if you regret your threat then great. but bizarre to tell people they got the story wrong.</i>: Story is correct and unfortunate must add - for someone of your stature and position just thought you jumped on it </li>
<li><i><a href="http://twitter.com/bengoldacre/status/2638276214" title="http://twitter.com/bengoldacre/status/2638276214">BenGoldacre</a>: so nobody else was wrong, you were just bullshitting. thanks for clarifying. great escalation skills on ur part, respect!</i>: RT @ClinicalReader We're learning fast, also important to be humble & admit mistakes, see @eagledawg twt</li>

<h2>Day Three: No Steps Forward, Third Step Back</h2>

On the next day, there were new allegations of improper use of graphics.  Specifically, Chris Martin (<a href="http://twitter.com/coldpie" title="http://twitter.com/coldpie">coldpie</a> on Twitter) reported that <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.clinicalreader.com/images/tangle.jpg">an image</span> on the Clinical Reader website bore a striking resemblance to an image from the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090719104437/http://feedstitch.com/" title="301 Moved Permanently">Feedstitch</a> service.  The representatives at ClinicalReader Twitter account <span class="removed_link" title="http://twitter.com/allan_marks/status/2648381434">said</span>, "hi guys stock image purchased, seems uve been stitched" (with no attributing initials).  When prompted by Twitter users <a href="http://twitter.com/wawoodworth/statuses/2643223209" title="http://twitter.com/wawoodworth/statuses/2643223209">Andy Woodworth</a> (userid <a href="http://twitter.com/wawoodworth/" title="http://twitter.com/wawoodworth/">wawoodworth</a>), <a href="http://twitter.com/lukelibrarian/statuses/2642944182" title="http://twitter.com/lukelibrarian/statuses/2642944182">Mr.  Rosenberger</a>, and the <a href="http://twitter.com/feedstitch/statuses/2641728386" title="http://twitter.com/feedstitch/statuses/2641728386">FeedStitch</a> twitter account, the <span class="removed_link" title="http://twitter.com/allan_marks/status/2648390445">reply</span> was: "can DM details if you wish, thanks (RH)" ("RH" is a new set of initials used on the ClinicalReader account); there are no reports of ClinicalReader following through.  The firm behind the FeedStitch service <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.pointlesscorp.com/imitation-is-the-sincerest-form-of-theft/">posted a message</span> on their blog giving their version of the provenance of the graphic.</p>

<p>The discussion is not limited to Twitter and blog posts.  Other social media outlets are carrying on the discussion as well.  Noted in this arena are FriendFeed postings by <a href="http://friendfeed.com/rachelw/e8384091/clinicalreader-agreed-w-stevelawson-concerns" title="@clinicalreader agreed w/ @stevelawson &amp;quot;concerns... - Rachel Walden - FriendFeed">Rachel Walden</a> (with five additional comments) and <a href="http://friendfeed.com/stevelawson/249e046a/twitter-clinicalreader-stevelawson" title="Twitter / ClinicalReader: @stevelawson @eagledawg... - Steve Incandenza - FriendFeed">Mr. Lawson</a> (a.k.a. Steve Incandenza on FriendFeed, with 51 additional comments).  One delicious.com user added notes to the entry for the <a href="http://delicious.com/url/4717bec3c805663f34a23364c65aeb89" title="Everyone's bookmarks for "Clinical Reader: Research articles, news and multimedia for doctors..." on Delicious">ClinicalReader homepage</a>: "Clinical Reader has been called out by medical librarians because of sloppy copyright practices and use of false implied endorsements by NLM &amp; others. To gain credibility as source of authoritative content, CR team needs to tread carefully!"  Still, either with a naive sense of how social networking tools work or in an attempt to put a brave face on what is happening, the people behind the ClinicalReader Twitter account post updates that seem to think all of this questioning of the ethics of the service provider is good for business.</p>

<p>The fourth day does not start well.  There are reports of <span class="removed_link" title="http://twitter.com/amuchmoreexotic/status/2670190813">ClinicalReader fabricating a quote posted in a retweet</span> and <a href="http://twitter.com/davidlrothman/status/2662042733" title="http://twitter.com/davidlrothman/status/2662042733">making up a retweet entirely</a>.</p>
<p>Then it would seem that some sanity has returned to Clinical Reader.  First there is a <span class="removed_link" title="http://twitter.com/allan_marks/status/2673399690">message</span> that Allan Marks has "taken control of this [Twitter] account" (At this point, Allan's name appears in the Twitter profile for the ClinicalReader account).  Then there is more action to remove the FeedStitch tangled strings graphic from the ClinicalReader site, with apologies to FeedStitch, Mr. Rosenberger, Mr. Goldacre, and others.  Mr. Marks thinks that the damage is contained; Mr. Rosenberger is <a href="http://www.quoteurl.com/zg90u" title="QuoteURL aggregation of dialog between Mr. Marks and Mr. Rosenberger">not so sure</a>.</p>
<p>There are more questions about the endorsement of people listed on the ClinicalReader pages.  In one case, Dr. Ves Dimov <a href="http://twitter.com/DrVes/status/2674453878" title="http://twitter.com/DrVes/status/2674453878">says</a>, "In case you are not sure: tweets and links do not represent endorsement, approval or support..."  This is apparently in regards to Dr. Dimov's inclusion of Clinical Reader on <a href="http://casesblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/how-to-make-medical-rss-aggregators.html" title="Clinical Cases and Images - Blog: How to make medical RSS aggregators better">a list of medical RSS aggregation services</a>.  Mr. Rosenberger <a href="http://twitter.com/lukelibrarian/status/2674587867" title="http://twitter.com/lukelibrarian/status/2674587867">responds</a>, "@DrVes re: tweets as endorsements: @ClinicalReader includes a @vesd tweet under 'what others are saying' on this page: http://bit.ly/SZ3SQ" (the shortened URL goes to the Clinical Reader latest newsletter page, which, at the time of writing, returns an "unauthorized" error).  To which Dr. Dimov <a href="http://twitter.com/DrVes/status/2674676029" title="http://twitter.com/DrVes/status/2674676029">replies</a>, "@lukelibrarian The product interface is still good, the management however has made some very strange decisions.Updated: [list of RSS aggregators]."  But Mr. Marks replies, "Hi yes thats correct please liaise with @vesd for confirmation - more than happy to be open thanks" (original tweet now deleted; text taken from <a href="http://www.iterasi.net/openviewer.aspx?sqrlitid=wpnufvqucuqwil67t80cga" title="from:clinicalreader - Twitter Search 01/19">archive</a>).  Mr. Rosenberger then <a href="http://twitter.com/lukelibrarian/status/2674709963" title="http://twitter.com/lukelibrarian/status/2674709963">says</a>, "dude, @vesd = @DrVes, who just tweeted 'tweets ...do not represent endorsement, approval or support' http://bit.ly/QGIvS" and Mr. Marks replies, "happy to get this removed if @vesd says so luke" (original tweet now deleted; text taken from <a href="http://www.iterasi.net/openviewer.aspx?sqrlitid=wpnufvqucuqwil67t80cga" title="from:clinicalreader - Twitter Search 01/19">archive</a>).</p>
<p>On the following day, Medical Library Association president Connie Schardt <a href="http://twitter.com/cschardt/status/2692879324" title="http://twitter.com/cschardt/status/2692879324">tweets</a> "RT@ClinicalReader I did NOT endorse your product as President of the Medical Library Association; please remove the misleading endorsement" followed shortly by <del datetime="2009-07-21T01:36:41+00:00">a mysterious</del> <ins datetime="2009-07-21T01:36:41+00:00">another</ins> <a href="http://twitter.com/cschardt/status/2692966607" title="http://twitter.com/cschardt/status/2692966607">tweet</a>: "@gabeboldt -- I didn't endorce this product as the President of the Medical Library Association; you gave them a misleading endorsement" <del datetime="2009-07-21T01:36:41+00:00">-- there is nothing in Twitter user <a href="http://twitter.com/gabeboldt" title="http://twitter.com/gabeboldt">gabeboldt</a>'s <span class="removed_link" title="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=&amp;ands=&amp;phrase=&amp;ors=&amp;nots=&amp;tag=&amp;lang=all&amp;from=gabeboldt&amp;to=&amp;ref=&amp;near=&amp;within=15&amp;units=mi&amp;since=2009-07-16&amp;until=2009-07-18&amp;rpp=15">timeline from around this time</span> that would account for that message</del>.  <ins datetime="2009-07-21T01:36:41+00:00">Ms. Schardt was reacting to an image of a tweet in the "Twitter Buzz" section at the bottom of the "Health Tweets" page.  This page is <span class="removed_link" title="http://clinicalreader.com/health_tweets.htm">no longer</span> on the Clinical Reader site at the time of writing, but a <a href="http://twitpic.com/b2cma" title="Cached version of http://clinicalreader.com/health_tweets.htm... on Twitpic">screen shot</a> of the <span class="removed_link" title="http://74.125.95.132/search?q=cache:clinicalreader.com/health_tweets.htm">Google web cache version</span> of the page is available.</ins></p>
<h2>The Weekend</h2>
<p>On Friday evening, Allan Marks, presumably in control of the ClinicalReader Twitter account, renamed it to "clincal_tweets".  This was first <a href="http://twitter.com/lukelibrarian/statuses/2693991479" title="http://twitter.com/lukelibrarian/statuses/2693991479">announced</a> by Mr. Rosenberger: "@clinicalreader is now @clinical_tweets - all tweet hx &amp; followers intact, just breaks hx links. slick."  Mr. Rosenberger later <a href="http://twitter.com/lukelibrarian/statuses/2697140296" title="http://twitter.com/lukelibrarian/statuses/2697140296">notes</a>: "after apparently renaming @clinicalreader as @clinical_tweets, 'aa' has now opened new acct w/0 followers named (wait 4 it) @clinicalreader"  In actuality, <span class="removed_link" title="http://twitter.com/clinicalreader/statuses/2724614595">it was someone else</span>: "BTW I'm just a witness to the mess which occurred last week. I saw an opportunity to register this account when it moved to @clinical_tweets" (note that this person uses the <span class="removed_link" title="http://83degrees.com/to/powertwitter">Power Twitter</span> client -- a client that was not used by anyone previously associated with Clinical Reader).</p>
<p>Some time overnight on Saturday, the original ClinicalReader Twitter account was renamed again from "clinical_tweets" to "<a href="http://twitter.com/allan_marks/" title="http://twitter.com/allan_marks/">amarks7</a>".  We know this because the history of tweet updates and the list of followers remain intact.  This is presumably the same Allan Marks that described himself as the co-founder of Clinical Reader.  In addition to renaming the account twice, Mr. Marks deletes controversial Twitter messages.  (This may continue and, as a result, some of the links to Twitter in this posting may no longer work; they were functional at the time this document was originally posted.)  Another individual subsequently creates a new "<span class="removed_link" title="http://twitter.com/clinical_tweets/">clinical_tweets</span>" with a real name of "Ex Staff" and a Canadian flag as the profile image.  Is this someone from the fired staff of Clinical Reader?  Without an acknowledgement from an official Clinical Reader channel, we can't be sure.</p>

<p>On Saturday afternoon, a twitter account "<a href="http://twitter.com/clinical_reader/" title="http://twitter.com/clinical_reader/">clinical_reader</a>" was created with these messages and other messages that give the appearance of being the official Clinical Reader Twitter account.  With the subsequent registration of the "<span class="removed_link" title="http://twitter.com/clinical_tweet/">clinical_tweet</span>" Twitter account and no postings on the Clinical Reader website, we can't be sure which of these channels are official.</p>

<p>This blog post has been sitting in my account for a number of evenings as each day brings new events and new revelations.  I don't doubt that there will be changes to the story.  If new events have a lesson in them, I'll try to update this post.</p>
<h2>Observations</h2>
<p>Closing in on nearly 3,000 words, this posting is already long.  Observations and recommendations, as a result, were moved to a <a href="http://dltj.org/article/learning-from-clinical-reader/">subsequent <acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester"><i>DLTJ</i></acronym> post</a> so as not to get lost at the end of this one.</p>
