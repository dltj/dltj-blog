If you have been following social media news, you know that Twitter is having its issues. 
Although there is still a bit to go before it goes away (or, more likely, puts up a paywall to view tweets), it seems prudent to save Twitter content so it can be viewed later. 
Most people do this with a screenshot of a tweet, but that doesn't capture the fidelity of the Twitter experience. 

Ed Summers pointed out a {% include robustlink.html href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-police-government-surveillance-covid-19-3f3f348d176bc7152a8cb2dbab2e4cc4" versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20230204174731/https://apnews.com/article/technology-police-government-surveillance-covid-19-3f3f348d176bc7152a8cb2dbab2e4cc4" versiondate="2023-02-04" title="Police seize on COVID-19 tech to expand global surveillance | AP News" anchor="recent article" %} from the Associated Press that embedded a functional archive of a tweet. (Scroll down nearly to the end of the article.)

%}
<div style='clear:both'></div>

That looked interesting, so with the help of hints from Ed, I [embedded a tweet in last week's newsletter](https://dltj.org/article/issue-98-time-standards/#aliens).

This is how I did it...plus some helpful advice along the way.

## Installing Browsertrix
{: #browsertrix}

Our goal is to use ReplayWeb to embed a bit of the Twitter experience into a stand-alone web page. 
(More on ReplayWeb [below](#replayweb).)
The tool uses a {% include robustlink.html href="https://replayweb.page/docs/wacz-format" versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20230204203859/https://replayweb.page/docs/wacz-format" versiondate="2023-02-04" title="Web Archive Collection Format Specification " anchor="WACZ file" %} to do this; a WACZ file is the contents of a series of Web Archive files as a Zip file for easy transport.
At the moment, the only free tool that I could find to create the WACZ file is Browsertrix Cloud. 

{% include robustlink.html href="https://browsertrix.cloud/" versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20230204204644/https://browsertrix.cloud/" versiondate="2023-02-04" title="Browsertrix Cloud homepage" anchor="Browsertrix Cloud" %} building a hosted service for organizations that want to have high-fidelity web archives, and it is also making its core code available as open source. 
Its {% include robustlink.html href="https://docs.browsertrix.cloud/deploy/local/" versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20230204204714/https://docs.browsertrix.cloud/deploy/local/" versiondate="2023-02-04" title="Local Deployment | Browsertrix Cloud Docs" anchor="local deployment instructions" %} instructions are really good, but one of the things that put me off was the Kubernetes requirement. 
(Kubernetes is a highly-complicated, highly-robust tool for orchestrating the containers that make up a distributed application.) 
Fortunately, the Browsertrix local deployment instructions point out that recent versions of Docker Desktop include Kubernetes as an optional component. 
So I started with the four list items under the _Docker Desktop (recommended for Mac and Windows)_ heading.

<div style="border-color: #00bfa5;border: .05rem solid #448aff;	border-radius: .2rem;	font-size: .64rem;margin: 1.5625em 0;padding: 0 .6rem;page-break-inside: avoid;">
<summary style="color: black;background-color: #00bfa5;">Docker Desktop (recommended for Mac and Windows)</summary>
<p style="">For Mac and Windows, we recommend testing out Browsertrix Cloud using Kubernetes support in Docker Desktop as that will be one of the simplest options.</p>
<ol style="">
<li style="">
<p style=""><a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/" style="">Install Docker Desktop</a> if not already installed.</p>
</li>
<li style="">
<p style="">From the Dashboard app, ensure <code style="">Enable Kubernetes</code> is checked from the Preferences screen.</p>
</li>
<li style="">
<p style="">Restart Docker Desktop if asked, and wait for it to fully restart.</p>
</li>
<li style="">
<p style="">Install <a href="https://helm.sh/" style="">Helm</a>, which can be installed with <code style="">brew install helm</code> (Mac) or <code style="">choco install kubernetes-helm</code> (Windows) or following some of the <a href="https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/" style="">other install options</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>

From there, get Browsertrix running:

1. `git clone https://github.com/webrecorder/browsertrix-cloud`
1. `cd browsertrix-cloud`
1. `helm upgrade --install -f ./chart/values.yaml -f ./chart/examples/local-config.yaml btrix ./chart/`
1. `kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod --all --timeout=300s`
1. Go to [localhost:30870/](http://localhost:30870/) and sign in with `admin@example.com` with `PASSW0RD!` as the password.

Tip: the first time I ran `helm upgrade ...`, the back end timed out waiting for the database container to download and start. 
I saw this because the default username/password was not accepted. 
The solution was to `helm uninstall btrix` and `kubectl delete pvc --all` then run the helm-upgrade command again. 
For the second `helm upgrade ...`, the container images will have been already downloaded and cached, so the initialization will happen as expected.

## Capture the tweet 

To get an isolated view of the tweet, we're going to use [oembed.link](https://oembed.link).
"[oEmbed](https://oembed.com/)" is a _de facto_ standard for:

> a format for allowing an embedded representation of a URL on third party sites. The simple API allows a website to display embedded content (such as photos or videos) when a user posts a link to that resource, without having to parse the resource directly.

The oEmbed is intended to be just the primary content of the page; it excludes toolbars, navigation elements, and other parts of the page framework. 
A bunch of big sites support it: Twitter, TikTok, YouTube, Tumblr, Facebook, etc.
Many blog platforms support oEmbed by just putting the URL to the content you want to embed onto a line by itself. 
(You might be using oEmbed without even knowing the name or technology behind it; see the {% include robustlink.html href="https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/embeds/" versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20230127052647/https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/embeds/" versiondate="2023-01-27" title="Embeds | WordPress documentation" anchor="documentation at WordPress" %}, for instance.) 
We're going to use oembed.link to get the same thing, but turn it into a web archive first.
In this example, we are going to archive [https://twitter.com/DataG/status/1585816108908662788](https://twitter.com/DataG/status/1585816108908662788), which in oembed.link looks like [this](https://oembed.link/https://twitter.com/DataG/status/1585816108908662788).

1. From the main Browsertrix page, select "All organizations" in the upper right corner and pick "admin's Archive".
1. Select the "Crawl Configs" tab.
1. Select "New Crawl Config" then select "URL list"
1. In the "Scope" tab that comes up, put the oembed.link URL into the text box. For the sake of completeness, it probably also makes sense to put the original Twitter URL in the text box for archiving as well. See screenshot below.
1. The settings in the "Limits", "Browser Settings", and "Scheduling" tabs can remain unchanged. (Or experiment!)
1. In the "Information" tab, I use a more meaningful name than the first URL captured. For instance, to capture the `https://twitter.com/DataG/status/1585816108908662788` tweet I set it to "twitter-DataG-1585816108908662788" â€” the origin website, account, and identifier separated by dashes.
1. Select "Review & Save" then "Save & Run Crawl"

{% include image.html

caption="Screen capture of the crawl configuration 'Scope' page from Browsertrix."
%}

As the web archive capture starts, you'll see the running status. 
My tweet crawl took about a minute to run. 
When it is done, the "Files" tab will have a link to your WACZ file.

First step done!

## Embed the tweet archive onto a page

Next we're going to use 
{% include robustlink.html href="https://replayweb.page/docs/" versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20230204183050/https://replayweb.page/docs/" versiondate="2023-02-04" title="User Guide: replayweb.page" anchor="ReplayWeb" %} to embed the captured archive in a mini-browser running inside our web page. 
ReplayWeb reads the contents of the archive and dynamically injects the archived pages into the DOM as an &lt;iframe&gt;. 
It is really cool.

The {% include robustlink.html href="https://replayweb.page/docs/embedding" versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20230204190204/https://replayweb.page/docs/embedding" versiondate="2022-0204" title="Embedding Web Archives with ReplayWeb.page | ReplayWeb documentation" anchor="embedding ReplayWeb documentation" %} is quite good as well. 
I'm choosing to self-host its JavaScript, so I downloaded the [ui.js](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/replaywebpage/ui.js) and [sw.js](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/replaywebpage/sw.js) files and put them in the "assets" directory on my blog's static site. 

To embed the tweet, add the JavaScript and the &lt;replay-web-page&gt; tag to your HTML. For the DLTJ blog, that looks like this:

{% highlight html linenos %}
<script src="/assets/js/replayweb/ui.js"></script>
<replay-web-page 
  replayBase="/assets/js/replayweb/" 
  source="https://media.dltj.org/web-archive/twitter-DataG-1585816108908662788.wacz" 
  url="https://oembed.link/https://twitter.com/DataG/status/1585816108908662788"
  embed="replay-with-info"
  style="height:27em;">  
</replay-web-page>
<noscript><img
 src="https://dltj.org/assets/images/2023/2023-02-04-tweet-1585816108908662788.png"
 alt="...alt text for static image...">
</noscript>
{% endhighlight %}

{: #help-needed}
...which looks like this when rendered in the browser:

<script src="/assets/js/replayweb/ui.js"></script>
<replay-web-page 
  replayBase="/assets/js/replayweb/" 
  source="https://media.dltj.org/web-archive/twitter-DataG-1585816108908662788.wacz" 
  url="https://oembed.link/https://twitter.com/DataG/status/1585816108908662788"
  embed="replay-with-info"
  style="height:27em;">  
</replay-web-page>
<noscript><img
 src="https://dltj.org/assets/images/2023/2023-02-04-tweet-1585816108908662788.png"
 alt="Screenshot of a tweet dated 27-Oct-2022 that says: For what itâ€™s worth, you will find me more active on Mastodon at https://code4lib.social/web/@dltj than here. The automated tools will continue to repost content. Godspeed, Twitter.">
</noscript>

Some notes:

- Line 3: Note the addition of the `replayBase` attribute. Since I'm self-hosting and I'm not putting the ReplayWeb JavaScript at the same location as the WACZ file, I have to explicitly tell ReplayWeb the location of the back-end service worker JavaScript file.
- Line 5: The `url` attribute controls what is displayed from the archive. Remember that we archived two pages: the oembed.link page and the twitter.com page.
- Line 6: There are several `embed` modes...the `replay-with-info` mode adds the header at the top that explains how this is a web archive.
- Line 7: I'm having to use an in-line style to force the height of the embedded content to approximate the height of the tweet. My knowledge of modern CSS styling is quite weak, so there is probably a better way to do this...suggestions welcome!
- Line 9: Just in case JavaScript is turned off (or if all of this ReplayWeb stuff breaks someday), inside a &lt;noscript&gt; tag there is a static image of the tweet as well. I use this [Tweet Screenshot tool](https://htmlcsstoimage.com/examples/twitter-tweet-screenshot) to make the image.

So that is all there is to it. 
A little bit convolutedâ€”especially the Browsertrix part to get the WACZ fileâ€”but on the whole not too bad.
There is a [web forum for the Webrecorder](https://forum.webrecorder.net/) community working on these various pieces, and that is probably the best place to go if you have questions or observations.
(I'm not a participant in that communityâ€”just a happy user of its projects.)

## Special note for embedding Mastodon posts

Mastodon supports oEmbed, too, via an "automatic discovery" mechanism. 
Unfortunately, [it seems like oembed.link uses the hard-coded list of oEmbed providers rather than automatic discovery](https://github.com/webrecorder/oembed.link/issues/2), so Mastodon instances don't work there at the moment. 
But! If you know the magic URL pattern, you can capture Mastodon posts, too:

<replay-web-page 
  replayBase="/assets/js/replayweb/" 
  source="https://media.dltj.org/web-archive/code4lib.social-@dltj-109804263650810404.wacz" 
  url="https://code4lib.social/@dltj/109804263650810404/embed"
  embed="replay-with-info"
  style="height:19em;">  
</replay-web-page>

The link to the post on Mastodon is `https://code4lib.social/@dltj/109804263650810404` and you just need to add `/embed` onto the end to get the oEmbed version:

https://code4lib.social/@dltj/109804263650810404/embed

That is probably better, really, because it isn't relying on an external service to get the content...it looks more legitimate.
