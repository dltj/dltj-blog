<p>Threads this week without commentary.  (It has been a long week that included only one flight of four that actually happened without a delay, cancellation, or redirection.)  Big announcements are one from the Library of Congress to <a href="#p2906-replace-marc">re-envision the way bibliographic information travels</a>, one from Douglas County (Colorado) Library's <a href="#p2906-cipa-dcl">experiment with taking ownership of ebooks and applying its own digital rights management</a>, and a <a href="#p2906-spam">study on the ecosystem of spam</a>.</p>

<h2 id="p2906-replace-marc">Transforming our Bibliographic Framework: A Statement from the Library of Congress</h2>
<blockquote><p>Spontaneous comments from participants in the US RDA Test show that a broad cross-section of the community feels budgetary pressures but nevertheless considers it necessary to replace MARC 21 in order to reap the full benefit of new and emerging content standards.  The Library now seeks to evaluate how its resources for the creation and exchange of metadata are currently being used and how they should be directed in an era of diminishing budgets and heightened expectations in the broader library community.

<h2 id="p2906-cipa-dcl">Douglas County Library to Distribute Ebooks with its own DRM</h2>
<blockquote><p>We are pleased to announce a partnership between the <a href="http://www.CIPABooks.com" target="_blank" title="Join CIPA - We're Independent Publishers Working Together&amp;nbsp; 303-365-CIPA (303-365-2472)">Colorado Independent Publishers Association (CIPA)</a>, and two Colorado libraries: <a href="http://www.rrcc.edu/library/" target="_blank" title="Red Rocks Community College :: Success Your Way">Red Rocks Community College Library</a>, and Douglas County Libraries.</p>
<p>Many members of CIPA have entered the world of digital publishing.

<h2 id="p2906-spam">Study Says Spam Can Be Cut by Blocking Card Transactions</h2>
<blockquote><p>For years, a team of computer scientists at two <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/university_of_california/index.html" title="More articles about the University of California in the New York Times">University of California</a> campuses has been looking deeply into the nature of <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/spam_electronic_mail/index.html" title="More articles about spam in the New York Times">spam</a>, the billions of unwanted e-mail messages generated by networks of zombie computers controlled by the rogue programs called botnets. They even coined a term, &ldquo;<a title="The related research paper." href="http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/pubs/networking/2008-ccs-spamalytics.pdf">spamalytics</a>,&rdquo; to describe their work.</p>
<p>Now they have concluded an experiment that is not for the faint of heart: for three months they set out to receive all the spam they could (no quarantines or filters need apply), then systematically made purchases from the Web sites advertised in the messages. </p></blockquote>
