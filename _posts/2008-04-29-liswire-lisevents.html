<p>Blake Carver (of <a href="http://lisnews.org/" title="LISNews | Librarian And Information Science News">LISNews</a> and <a href="http://lishost.com/" title="LISHost Librarian Web Hosting Library Web Hosting and Design">LISHost</a> fame) announced two new projects yesterday:  <a href="http://liswire.com/" title="LISWire - The Librarian&#039;s News Wire">LISWire</a> and <a href="http://lisevents.com/" title="LISEvents - The Librarian&#039;s Events">LISEvents</a>.  In the same spirit that I would categorize open source, open access, and open knowledge, these services level the playing field for the publication of library-oriented press releases and announcements of events.</p>
<h2>LISWire - The Librarian's News Wire</h2>
<p>For the publication of press releases and other newsy information, <a href="http://liswire.com/" title="LISWire - The Librarian&#039;s News Wire">LISWire</a> is a service targeted towards the librarian community.  Looking for announcements related to public libraries?  Try <a href="http://liswire.com/taxonomy/term/24/" title="Public Libraries | LISWire">http://liswire.com/taxonomy/term/24/</a>.  How about items about open source in academic libraries? <a href="http://liswire.com/taxonomy/term/23,27" title="Academic Libraries, Open Source | LISWire">http://liswire.com/taxonomy/term/23,27</a> is the URL for you.  Interested in both announcements from both for-profit and not-for-profit organizations?  Then look at <a href="http://liswire.com/taxonomy/term/35+36" title="For Profit, Non-Profit | LISWire">http://liswire.com/taxonomy/term/35+36</a>.  Best of all, these URLs work in your browser <em>and</em> your RSS reader; you see the same content either way.  I think we need some work on the taxonomies; I'm going to send my suggestions to Blake and Robin Blum (his collaborator) and suggest you do, too.</p>
<h2>LISEvents - The Librarian's Events</h2>
<p>Built on the same concept as LISWire is <a href="http://lisevents.com/" title="LISEvents - The Librarian&#039;s Events">a draft of a site for posting information about events</a>.  This is definitely still a work in progress, but the same capabilities and possibilities are showing through.  I think it would be useful to add a taxonomy for location so that it would be possible to see events in, say, Ohio and/or the midwest region; I can easily see myself subscribing to such a feed to keep up with what is going on in the area.  And let's not forget an "online region" for webinars and similar events.</p>
<p>Congratulations Blake and Robin, and thanks for trying to build these services for our community.  If they take off, they will be a real, tangible benefit for us.
