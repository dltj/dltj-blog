    that the Library of Congress and Xerox are teaming up on j2k implementation, and
    even more welcome that it's in context of NDIIPP and preservation.  This is a

This is welcome news!  The project is "designed to help develop guidelines and best practices for digital content," a result that will be most welcome for those of us that want to do the right thing but lack the time and/or technical expertise to pin down exactly what the right thing is.  I think it is safe to say that inertia has taken us this far with our collective TIFF-based practice, and even the most conservative preservationist would probably acknowledge that the state of the art has moved in the past quarter century to a point where there might be a better way.</p>
<p>I'm familiar with Rob Buckley's work at Xerox, and that he is overseeing Xerox's efforts in this collaboration means we can anticipate a great outcome.  As <a href="http://blog.historians.org/2007/10/library-of-congress-and-xerox-to-team-up-on-digital-formats/" title="American Historical Association Blog: Library of Congress and Xerox to Team Up on Digital Formats">others</a> have <a href="http://philobiblos.blogspot.com/2007/10/lc-and-xerox-to-tackle-digital-image.html" title="PhiloBiblos: LC and Xerox to Tackle Digital Image Format">noted</a>, the time is ripe for work in this area.</p>
