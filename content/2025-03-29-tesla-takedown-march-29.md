I don't know how many there were at the protest today in front of the [Easton Tesla store](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/374886272), but for the first time we covered all four corners of the intersection.

I think there were at least 600 people...maybe more. 
Some observations:

1. The weather was good—windy, but warm—and the families with young children did come out again. But there were just MORE people there overall.
1. This week I recognized more cars making a circuit around the block. More people honking with thumbs up, turning around, then coming back again. I don't remember seeing that on past Saturdays.
1. There were more Tesla sedans driving by that I remember seeing in the past. Quite possibly, they were just making the circuit around the block, too.
1. I'm starting to recognize familiar faces at each protest.

There was no live music this time, but that was okay because there was definitely more noise from the sidewalks and more energy in the air. 
The Proud Boys made noise about coming in counter-protest, but I didn't see them. 
One of the event marshals said they were there early, but the police effectively separated them. As the panorama picture shows, though, we had all four corners covered and we were raucous.

## This week's protest sign {: #sign}

I went off-script this week with a sign about the political nonsense we have at the moment. 
It is a play on the phrase "The call is coming from inside the house!" — a play on a {{ robustlink(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_babysitter_and_the_man_upstairs", versionurl="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_babysitter_and_the_man_upstairs&oldid=1281634897", versiondate="2025-03-29", title="The babysitter and the man upstairs | Wikipedia", anchor="famous movie trope") }} where the police tell the person in a home that they have traced the antagonist's call to that home. 
In this case, the danger to democracy is coming from _inside the Whitehouse!_ 
Or, at least, that is what I was aiming for. 
This sign probably only get's one week's use; let's hope by next week, one or more people on this sign are fired because of the released of what sure looks like classified information on a Signal group chat.

If you want to use this 26" by 16" sign for yourself, I've made it [available for download](https://dltj.org/assets/attachments/Signal%20protest%20sign.pdf).
