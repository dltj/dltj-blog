  content: "How did you find those Wolfram alpha test querries?\r\n\r\nMy experience
    at just plunking random questions in (either because I have an actual question,
    or to try adn put it through it's paces) have been that VERY rarely does Wolfram
    Alpha know what I'm asking or have an answer. \r\n\r\nThis leads me to be somewhat
    less than excited about it. \r\n\r\nMy latest failure, \"Current price of U.S.
    first class stamp\".  Which I actually wanted to know. Seems like something it
    might know, doesn't it? But not."

    JesterHere&#39;s a great comparison of three new search tools created by Peter
    Murray (the Disruptive Library Technology Jester). He describes each of the tools
    and then suggests some sample searches to use to compare them. He also has a screencast
    on the page of sample searches he has used on the tools to highlight their capabilities.

  content: Jonathan -- I found the examples by trial and error (looking at the <a
    href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/examples/" title="Wolfram|Alpha Examples" rel="nofollow">examples
    by topic</a> and <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/gallery.html" title="Wolfram|Alpha
    Visual Gallery of Examples" rel="nofollow">visual gallery of examples</a> on the
    Wolfram|Alpha site) as well as some interesting searches that others had found
    and reported in an <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5257400/" rel="nofollow">article
    on Lifehacker</a>.  It is admittedly hit-or-miss, though, because the datasets
    have to be curated and linked together by humans (limited by human-time, of course).  That
    is what makes the comparison between Alpha and Google Squared so interesting,
    since Google is trying to pick out the semantics of the facts from web pages.

    I am getting a D&eacute;j&agrave; vu effect while going through the &ldquo;Google
    Squared&rdquo; application because it appears to be very similar in function to
    my United States patent application which was filed on April 12, 2007 and as publicly
    disclosed by the United States Patent and Trademark Office on October 16, 2008,
    when the patent application was published. \r\n\r\nMy patent application is titled
    as &ldquo;Method And System For Research Using Computer Based Simultaneous Comparison
    And Contrasting Of A Multiplicity Of Subjects Having Specific Attributes Within
    Specific Contexts&rdquo; bearing Document Number &ldquo;20080256023&rdquo; and
    Inventor name &ldquo;Nair Satheesh&rdquo; which may be viewed at http://patft.uspto.gov/
    upon Patent Applications: Quick Search. \r\n\r\nGoogle Squared appears to be using
    at least some if not many of the same methods and systems as set forth by me more
    than two years ago in my patent application. In fact there are many more methods
    and systems disclosed in my patent application which I believe will help resolve
    certain inaccuracies found in current Google Squared application.\r\n\r\nI have
    issued legal notices to Google through my Patent Attorney in the US but Google
    has not responded yet to any of my notices."

---
<p>It has been a wild few weeks in search engines -- or search-engine-like services.   We've seen the introduction of no fewer than three high-profile tools ... <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/" title="Wolfram|Alpha homepage" rel="homepage">Wolfram|Alpha</a>, <a href="http://www.bing.com/" title="Microsoft Bing homepage" rel="homepage">Microsoft Bing</a>, and <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.google.com/squared">Google Squared</span>  ... each with their own strengths and needing their own techniques -- or, at least, their own distinct frame of reference -- in order to maximize their usefulness.  This post describes these three services, what their generally good for, and how to use them.  We'll also do a couple of sample searches to show how each is useful in its own way.</p>
<h2>Wolfram|Alpha</h2>
<p>The first new service, chronologically, is <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/" title="Wolfram|Alpha homeapage" rel="homepage">Wolfram|Alpha</a>.  The answer to the first question of its FAQ, "Is Wolfram|Alpha a search engine?", tells you that it is something different:<br />
<blockquote>No. It's a computational knowledge engine: it generates output by doing computations from its own internal knowledge base, instead of searching the web and returning links.</p></blockquote>
<p>  A "computational knowledge engine"?  What's that?  It is an attempt to gather facts, formulas, and natural language processing algorithms, encode them all in the language of <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/products/mathematica/" title="Mathematica software information">Mathematica</a> (don't worry -- the Wolfram|Alpha folks do that for us), and answer any factual question posed to it.  An ambitious goal?  It sure is, and the state of the system now is an impressive start.  According to the service's <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/about.html" title="About Wolfram|Alpha">about page</a>, "Wolfram|Alpha contains 10+ trillion of pieces of data, 50,000+ types of algorithms and models, and linguistic capabilities for 1000+ domains."</p>
<p>So what is Wolfram|Alpha good for?  Fact and computations about facts.   The service already knows a lot about the world:  geography, economics and socioeconomic data, physics, chemistry, engineering, sports, units of measurement, weather, and even music.  The results come back as graphs, maps, simple facts, and tables.  There is usually a "Source Information" link that lets you know how it got the answer.</p>
<p>Enough background, below are some things to try (some examples taken from <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5257400/" title="Lifehacker - First Look at Wolfram Alpha's Impressive (and Fun) Knowledge Computation - Wolfram Alpha">Lifehacker</a>).  If you want more, be sure to check out the services <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/examples/" title="Wolfram|Alpha Examples">Examples by Topic</a> and <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/gallery.html" title="Wolfram|Alpha Visual Gallery of Examples">Visual Gallery of Examples</a>.</p>

<p>How is Wolfram|Alpha different than the typical web search engine that crawls the web and processes keyword searches?  The first difference is in the input:  all of the facts, formulas and relationships between data points are curated by real humans.  A search engine crawls the web, indexes whatever text it can find, and attempts to compute relevance of a page based on the number and quality of links leading to that page.  The researchers behind Wolfram|Alpha select the data sets to put into the system, and go to great length to link data sets together.  The second difference is in how it processes the user's query:  Wolfram|Alpha tries to determine the real meaning of the question being asked.  Natural language parsers attempt to determine the domain(s) of the question, and that becomes part of the computation for the answer.  (For instance, Wolfram|Alpha doesn't understand the meaning behind the question <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=How+many+goobles+are+in+a+pickus%3F" title="Wolfram|Alpha query for 'How many goobles are in a pickus?'">How many goobles are in a pickus?</a>, but <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=How+many+goobles+are+in+a+pickus" title="Google query for 'How many goobles are in a pickus?'">Google will give you 64 web pages</a> when it is asked the same question.  Wolfram|Alpha also <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=What+is+a+ball%3F" title="Wolfram|Alpha query for 'What is a ball?'">prompts you to disambiguate queries</a> that apply to multiple domains.)</p>
<p>Looking for more information?  <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/2009/05/04/how-important-is-wolframalpha/" title="'How important is WolframAlpha?' in Joho the Blog">David Weinberger</a> has a good analysis of the underpinnings of Wolfram|Alpha and what it might mean for those of us in the business of answering questions.  <a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2009/04/03/facts-and-friction/" title="'Facts and friction' in Jon Udell's blog">Jon Udell</a> talks about being able to "compute with facts in a more frictionless way."  There is also an article in the <i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i> that talks about how Wolfram|Alpha can be <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/A-Calculating-Web-Site-Could/47316/" title="A Calculating Web Site Could Ignite a New Campus &#039;Math War&#039; - Chronicle.com">used to answer mathematical questions</a> and show how to get to the answer; this is generating some consternation among math instructors.</p>
<p>And what is a geeky service without some easter eggs ((Easter eggs are messages, videos, graphics, sound effects, or an unusual change in program behavior that sometimes occur in a software program in response to some undocumented set of commands, mouse clicks, keystrokes or other stimuli intended as a joke or to display program credits. -- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_%28media%29?oldid=291125921#Software-based" title="Definition of 'Easter Egg' from Wikipedia">Definition courtesy of Wikipedia</a>))?  For instance, Wolfram|Alpha's response when you <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Hello" title="Wolfram|Alpha query for 'hello'">say "hello" to it</a>.  If you are a fan of 1960's culture, <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=How+many+roads+must+a+man+walk+down+before+you+can+call+him+a+man%3F" title="Wolfram|Alpha query for 'How many roads must a man walk down before you can call him a man?'">you can ask it "How many roads must a man walk down before you can call him a man?"</a>, with a nod to Bob Dylan.  Lost?  Wolfram|Alpha <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Where+am+I%3F" title="Wolfram|Alpha query for 'Where am i?'">knows where you are</a> -- or, at least, where your computer is.  It even has an answer for <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=how+much+wood+could+a+woodchuck+chuck+if+a+woodchuck+could+chuck+wood%3F" title="Wolfram|Alpha query for 'How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?'">How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?</a>  (Easter eggs courtesy of <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/05/17/wolfram-easter-eggs/" title="Wolfram easter eggs #1 from Mashable.com">two</a> <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/05/17/better-wolfram-easter-eggs/" title="Wolfram easter eggs #2 from Mashable.com">posts</a> at Mashable.com)</p>
<h2>Microsoft Bing</h2>
<p><i><a href="http://www.bing.com/" title="Microsoft Bing homepage" rel="homepage">Bing</a></i> is Microsoft's new search engine, replacing Live.com.  Of the three systems described in this post, it is the most similar to your experience with existing search engines.  Bing makes an extra effort to help searchers with some targeted topics; from the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2009/may09/05-28NewSearchPR.mspx" title="May 28, 2009, press release from Microsoft announcing Bing">Microsoft press release</a>:  "Microsoft&rsquo;s research identified shopping, travel, local business and information, and health-related research as areas in which people wanted more assistance in making key decisions. The current state of Internet search isn&rsquo;t optimized for these tasks, but the Bing Decision Engine is optimized for these key customer scenarios."  For readers that are academic librarians, those may not be topics geared towards academics but they might be useful in your own research.  In fact, I couldn't find anything in Bing's feature set that is particularly attractive to an academic community.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1007" align="alignright" width="178" caption="Bing search refinements"]<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/Columbus-OH-Bing-Sidebar.png" alt="Columbus OH Bing Sidebar" title="Columbus OH Bing Sidebar" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1026" width="174" height="192" />[/caption]That said, there are some tweaks over the competition that are interesting to look at.  One of the first things to notice is the list of search refinements along the left side.  A <a href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=columbus%2C+oh&amp;go=&amp;form=QBRE" title="columbus, oh - Bing">search on Bing for Columbus, OH</a>, for instance, includes links to search Bing for topics like <a href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=Columbus%2c+OH+Attractions&amp;qpvt=columbus%2c+oh&amp;FORM=Z7FD" title="Columbus, OH Attractions - Bing">attractions</a>, <a href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=Columbus%2c+OH+Hotels&amp;qpvt=columbus%2c+oh&amp;FORM=Z7FD3" title="Columbus, OH Hotels - Bing">hotels</a>, and <a href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=Columbus%2c+OH+Tourism&amp;qpvt=columbus%2c+oh&amp;FORM=Z7FD3" title="Columbus, OH Tourism - Bing">tourism</a>.  The refinements are different based on the context of the search term; for instance, you see different refinements in a <a href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=digital+cameras&amp;go=&amp;form=QBRE" title="digital cameras - Bing">search for digital cameras</a>.  As <a href="http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2009/05/hands-on-with-microsofts-new-search-to-bing-or-not-to-bing.ars" title="To Bing or not to Bing? Hands on with Microsoft&amp;#039;s new search - Ars Technica">Ars Technica points out</a>, the search refinements will even differ in the same type of search; the <a href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=toronto&amp;go=&amp;form=QBRE" title="toronto - Bing">search for Toronto</a>, for instance, has refinement links to weather, airport and real estate.  The left-side bar also shows suggested "related searches" (although it is not clear how "related searches" are different from the search refinement links above it) and your search history.</p>
<p>The interface also has other usability improvements -- thumbnails of videos will start playing when you mouse over them, the image search results employ "infinite scrolling" (where the browser will load additional hits in the background as you scroll down) and a variety of ways to limit results (in facets down the left side), and unique handling of "best matches" that allows for further navigation within a site (for instance, see the results page for "<a href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=Google" title="Bing search for 'Google'">Google</a>" and "<a href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=Ars+Technica" title="Bing search for 'Ars Technica'">Ars Technica</a>").</p>
<h2>Google Squared</h2>
<p>The last service is one that is in Google labs and is called "<span class="removed_link" title="http://www.google.com/squared">Google Squared</span>".  "Squared" refers to its ability construct a table of facts from two search terms, similar in result to a spreadsheet.  On one axis you can put a general search term -- say "roller coasters" as in the example from the <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/06/square-your-search-results-with-google.html" title="'Square your search results with Google Squared' in the Official Google Blog">service announcement</a> and across the other axis add headings that describe the facts you want to know about the search term -- such as height and speed.  The result is a <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.google.com/squared/search?q=roller+coasters">two dimensional table of results</span>.  You can add facts to your table by putting the term at the top of an empty column (say, for this example, "location").  [caption id="attachment_1032" align="alignright" width="300" caption="Google Squared results cell"]<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/Google-Squared-results-cell-300x296.png" alt="Google Squared results cell" title="Google Squared results cell" width="300" height="296" class="size-medium wp-image-1032" />[/caption] Click inside a cell and you can see the source of the answer, alternative answers, and the ability to change which answer is listed in the cell.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, Wolfram|Alpha is also a good tool for finding facts.  In contrasted with Wolfram|Alpha, though -- where all of the information is specifically curated to link up to each other -- the facts in Google Squared are collected from the web.  As such, you'll see variability of information, as this example screen shot of the speed of the Superman roller coaster shows.  But unlike Wolfram|Alpha, which may give you only the barest citation of data sources, with Squared you can go right to the page where the fact came from and use that page to determine the validity of the fact.  As with many of Google's services, it starts out okay but if it continues to get resources in the company we can expect it to get a lot better over time.</p>
<h2>Service Comparisons</h2>
<p>This screencast shows a comparison of the three services with three distinct searches that highlight the unique capabilities of each service.</p>

<p>Speaking of comparisons, a new service called "<a href="http://blindsearch.fejus.com/" title="Blind Search homepage" rel="homepage">Blind Search</a>" will allow you to <a href="http://blindsearch.fejus.com/?q=dltj" title="Blind Search comparison of a search for 'dltj'">run the same search</a> across Bing, Google, and Yahoo and allow you to compare the results.  The hits come back in three columns, but the search engine used to generate each column of hits isn't revealed until you select the search engine that gave you the best results.  So, in a blind test, you can see if one search engine is better than another in terms of the raw relevance ranked results without all of the additional bells and whistles of each service.</p>
