<p>So I don't know how this one slipped past me:  you can link directly into <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.oclc.org/worldcat/open/isbnissnlinking/default.htm">Open WorldCat via an ISBN/ISSN REST-based URL</span>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Now any Web site can create "Find in a Library" links for specific titles. The syntax for link URLs is straightforward and keyed on common numeric identifiers.<br />
http://www.oclc.org/worldcat/open/isbnissnlinking/default.htm</p></blockquote>
<p>For instance, a URL that gets directly to the ARL SPEC Kit on Patron Privacy that I wrote a number of years ago is:</p>
<p>http://worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/isbn/1594076103</p>
<p>Folks, it doesn't get much easier than that.  Compared to junk our OPACs are creating, that URL is absolutely gorgeous.  (And it is a real URL -- it doesn't pretend to be a real URL by redirecting you to some other, perhaps messier, place.  Nice work, OCLC!)</p>
<p><em>Update 22-Jan-2006:</em>  <a href="http://orweblog.oclc.org/Linking-to-OpenWorldCat/" title="Linking to OpenWorldCat - Lorcan Dempsey&amp;#039;s Weblog">Lorcan Dempsey describes</a> a new "bookmark me" feature on each OpenWorldCat page.</p>
<p>With this API you can not only find the holdings of your library (assuming you contribute holdings to OCLC) but also that of your neighbors.  Here in Ohio we have a rich tradition of union catalogs (anyone remember what the "O" in OCLC used to stand for?), but even with the <a href="http://olc1.ohiolink.edu/" title="OhioLINK Library Catalog">OhioLINK Central Catalog</a> you only have a limited perspective (academic libraries, in our case) of what is available.</p>
<p>So it begs the question -- exactly what are our local OPACs?  There are some deficiences -- for now -- to the Open WorldCat-as-OPAC concept:</p>
<ul>
<li>Holdings may be incomplete (what percentage of your holdings are in OCLC WorldCat?)</li>
<li>No local status (could be addressed with NCIP?)</li>
<li>Messy, messy linking problems to subscription services</li>
</ul>
<p>But there are some great benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easily see what your neighbors have</li>
<li>The power of FRBR that only OCLC (and, to a certain extent, RLG) can provide</li>
<li>A nice "Web 2.0" (whatever that means to you) interface</li>
<li>And, you guessed it, a huge economy of scale in the saving resources that each of us would spend doing it independently</li>
</ul>
<p>So what is our OPAC?  Perhaps in a post for another day...</p>
