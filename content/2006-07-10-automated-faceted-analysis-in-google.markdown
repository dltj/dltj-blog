  content: "It's been around for a couple of months, I think, but only for health
    and medical terms.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nWell, I did a little investigation, and found
    that actually, it's also there for some other topics: <a href=\"http://www.google.com/coop\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">\"Google Coop\"</a>. It's a human-intelligence-harnessing indexing
    thingy to augment search results. Hmmm.... There are several topics listed, and
    I got it to show up in search results for several medical-related things and also
    for travel information (try \"Honolulu\" and you get dining guides, etc.), but
    I tried a few searches around the other topics and got nothing. It seems to be
    very much in-progress."

  content: "It displays for some health topics but not for others - but the syntax
    seems to work whether or not the 'refine results' text appears (e.g. for \"asthma\"
    \ there is no 'refine results' option, but the \"more:...\" operator still works,
    and \"asthma more:condition_treatment\" gives you different results from a search
    on just \"asthma\".\r\n\r\nGood spotting, thanks :-)"

  content: I've seen posts on searchenginewatch.com suggesting this is a forthcoming
    feature of the forthcoming Google Health, which is why you found it for a medical
    search.  Similar facets display for "diabetes", "tuberculosis", or even just "kidney"
    (but not "knee injuries" or "health effects of diet").

    rel="nofollow">early tag line at the bottom of Google News pages</a>) with a new
    batch of computers and algorithms scanning the pages of the web for common terms.

    Out-Google Google thesis, I&#8217;m starting to have my doubts. First came what
    looked like automated faceted analysis in Google. That turned out to be Google
    Co-op Health &mdash; a human-driven effort to add metadata to selected websites
    that appear in the search engine results. (By the way&#8230;why didn&#8217;t we
    [the library profession] think of that? And now that it has been thought of why
    aren&#8217;t we doing more with enlisting the aid of experts from their own field
    in categorizing their segment of the world of information?) &#182; [...]"

<p>Has anyone else started seeing what looks to be faceted topical headings at the top of Google searches?  This past weekend I was the groomsman at my brother's wedding and had the unfortunate timing to catch a case of conjunctivitis in both eyes the day before the ceremony.  ("Does your camera have red-eye reduction setting?" I asked the photographer.  She seemed confused, so I continued:  "How about pink-eye reduction?"  She looked a little closer at my eyes, laughed, and said "That's what Photoshop is for.")  Wanting to know more, I did what any self-respecting information-finder would do -- I asked Google.  And here's what came up.</p>
<div style="padding: 10px; margin: 0.67em auto; border: thin solid silver;">
<img id="image85" src="/assets/images/2006/07/google.png" alt="[Image. Google Search Results for "Conjunctivitis"]" /></p>
<p style="font-family: verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-style: italic; font-size: smaller; padding-left: 1%; padding-right: 1%; line-height: 1.1; margin: 0.25em auto 0 auto;">
Google Search Results for "Conjunctivitis" showing a "Refine results" heading</p>
</div>
<h2>"Refine results"?  Where did that come from?</h2>
<p>We're used to Google showing us refined search results for things like street addresses (giving us maps), telephone numbers (offering reverse number lookup) and certainly cross-links into Google's Images, Froogle, and Scholar services, but this is the first time I've seen the main Google search index suggest a refined search back into the main Google search index.  </p>
<div style="padding: 10px; margin: 0.67em auto; border: thin solid silver;">
<img id="image86" src="/assets/images/2006/07/google2.png" alt="[Image. Google Search Results for "Conjunctivitis" refined by "Treatment"]" />
<p style="font-family: verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-style: italic; font-size: smaller; padding-left: 1%; padding-right: 1%; line-height: 1.1; margin: 0.25em auto 0 auto;">
Google Search Results for "Conjunctivitis" refined by the "Treatment" link.</p>
</div>
<p>Here we see a "more:" modifier in the single search box.  So where did this "Labeled" metadata coming from?  Is Google running algorithms against the search index (similar to Amazon's Statistically Improbable Phrases) to pull out this kind of faceted information?</p>
<p>Can anyone help sort this out?</p>
