<p>The <a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20090628150300/http://www.oclc.org/worldcat/catalog/policy/board/default.htm" title="Review Board of Shared Data Creation and Stewardship [OCLC - Policy for Use and Transfer of WorldCat Records]">OCLC Review Board on Shared Data Creation and Stewardship</a> is conducting a survey to gather opinions on OCLC's proposed Policy for Use and Transfer of WorldCat Records.  The survey is 6 pages long and took me about 20 minutes.  After the demographic information, the survey asks about your organization's practices for acquiring and sharing cataloging data.  This is followed by a series of questions stating your preference for the existing and the proposed policies, how those policies affect your organization's plans, and opinions about the roles of OCLC and WorldCat in sharing bibliographic records.  You are then offered a chance to provide your contact information to the external research organization gathering the data.  (The survey states that this information will not be provided to the OCLC review board.)</p>
<p>Here is the text of the announcement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Colleague:</p>
<p>As chair of the OCLC Review Board on Shared Data Creation and Stewardship, I invite you to participate in a Web-based survey among librarians and other interested constituents. The primary goal of this survey is to gather input from both OCLC members and non-members about a proposed OCLC policy, Policy for Use and Transfer of WorldCat(r) Records.</p>
<p>The Review Board will consider the results of this survey in its recommendations to OCLC.</p>
<p>Please review the existing guidelines and proposed policy if you have not already done so:</p>
