    Good points, Dorothea!

    <blockquote>I suspect some small-shop or indy developers will get heartburn at being told they're "providers." They're not, really; they're just building the software and putting it out there. Is there a way to capture that association?</blockquote>

    I struggled with naming this one, too.  Originally it was "Vendors" but that wasn't inclusive of organizations like LYRASIS.  "Provider" seemed a bit more neutral.  The model would enforce, though, a situation where a Person would have to create a Provider (or an equivalently-named entity) to be recognized as an independent developer.  I'm certainly open to other names for this entity or other ways to model it.

    This also points out the need for another ProviderType enumeration:  "community."  I'm thinking, for instance, of organizations like DuraSpace and Kuali and the Koha Foundation -- some place that is the home of the intellectual property of an open source project.  Is "community" the right word?

    <blockquote>An enumeration for PackageType? Really? That's a little scary. What's the process for suggesting new PackageTypes?</blockquote>

    Yeah, I thought there was a need for a controled vocabulary there to enable efficient browsing and searching.  I'm still working on proposed governance policies, but in order for the registry to work well in our delightfully anarchistic realm the process would need to be pretty efficient and light-weight.  Maybe a new term is created arbitrarily by the Person first entering details about the package (e.g. if there isn't an appropriate term, make one up), and the new term is subject to review by a group of volunteer registry stewards.

    <blockquote>I'm not really seeing how this db will answer question 2 (strengths/weaknesses); there doesn't seem to be any feature-comparison table.</blockquote>

    Hmmm, yeah.  An earlier version of the model had a Feature entity that was related to the enumeration of PackageType (so all packages of a certain type would share the same possible Features) and the Package entity.  It added significant complexity to the model, though, so I remember taking it out.  It looks like I should have left it in there, though.  <i>sigh</i>

    at the conceptual level with the E-R diagram. The underlying system is spec'd
    to be Drupal, so it will use the core users module and an events module. The key
    part I want to get across to the developer is the relationship between built-in
    entities and any entities (node types) that will have to be created. \n\n<blockquote>I

    more convinced that the added complexity to the model will be needed. \n\n<blockquote>I

    thought was that I wouldn't need to do any computing on the version attribute
    of a release. At most, it would be valuable to sort them chronologically and the
    date of the release would be sufficient to do that. You have a good point about
    how a release can have many versions as it goes through alpha, beta, and release
    candidate stages before hitting a gold master stage. This is complicated by the
    fact that some project's betas can be production-ready while another's would barely
    run. \n\nCode quality is a good suggestion. Would it be up to the person making
    the release to assign that value or it it better an attribute of a comment on
    a Version/Release?\n\n<blockquote>It might be easier to track Major numbers, date
    of releases, and quality of code (Beta, Gold)...</blockquote>\n\nThanks again.
    The input is much appreciated."

    Thanks, Jodi.

    <blockquote>Maybe the talk page of the diagram would be a good place to have comments?</blockquote>

    That is a good option, too. I'll take comments however I can get them!

    <blockquote>Is the license relevant?</blockquote>

    Sorry, I'm not following. Are you referring to the "licence" attribute in the model?  If so, I'm not sure if it is relevant, so that is one of the areas I'm looking for feedback. License is (arguably) important for those writing code and integrating code from othe projects. (The concern of including so-called 'viral' licenses.) I don't think libraries searching for software that matches their needs and capabilities are as concerned about that. Some validation of that opinion would be welcome, though!

<p>As part of the Mellon Foundation grant <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120624232639/http://www.lyrasis.org:80/News/Press-Releases/2011/LYRASIS-Receives-Grant-to-Support-Open-Source.aspx" title="LYRASIS Receives Grant to Support Open Source | LYRASIS news">funding the start-up</a> of <a href="http://www.lyrasis.org/LYRASIS%20Digital/Pages/default.aspx" title="LYRASIS Technology Services">LYRASIS Technology Services</a>, LTS is establishing a registry to provide in-depth comparative, evaluative, and version information about open source products.  This registry will be free for viewing and editing (all libraries, not just LYRASIS members, and any provider offering services for open source software in libraries).  <a href="http://drupal.org/" title="Drupal homepage">Drupal</a> will be the underlying content system, and it will be hosted by <a href="http://www.lyrasis.org/" title="LYRASIS homepage">LYRASIS</a>.</p>
<p>I'm seeking input on a data model that is intended to answer these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What open source options exist to meet a particular need of my library?</li>
<li>What are the strengths and weaknesses of an open source package?</li>
<li>My library has developers with skills in specific technologies. What open source packages mesh well with the skills my library has in-house?</li>
<li>Where can my library go to get training, documentation, hosting, and/or contract software development for a specific open source package?</li>
<li>Are any peers using this open source software?</li>
<li>Where is there more information about this open source software package? </li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="http://wiki.code4lib.org/index.php/Registry_E-R_Diagram" title="Registry E-R Diagram | Code4Lib wiki">entity-relationship data model and narrative surrounding it</a> are on the Code4Lib wiki.  Comments on the data model can be made as changes to the wiki document, replies posted here, or <a href="mailto:Peter.Murray@lyrasis.org?subject=Comment%20about%20Registry%20Data%20Model">e-mail sent directly to me</a>.  In addition to comments on the data model, I'm particularly interested in answers to these questions (also listed at the bottom of the wiki page):</p>
<ol>
<li>The model does not provide for a relationship between a person and a software package. Would such a relationship be useful? E.g., individuals self-identifying as affiliated with an open source software package.</li>
<li>The initial planning process did not account for the inclusion of packages that were not themselves end products. Should code libraries and support programs be included as packages in the registry? The model could conceivably be adjusted in two ways to account for this. The simplest would only require the addition of new PackageType enumerations (e.g. &ldquo;code library&rdquo;); this would not allow for searching of packages that use code libraries (e.g., answering the question &ldquo;What repositories use the djatoka JPEG2000 viewer system?&rdquo;) Another simple change would be to add &ldquo;code library&rdquo; to the TechType enumeration; the code library would not have the benefit of links to other relationships and entities.  A more complicated change would do both but there would be no relationship between the code library as a Package and as a Technology.  Are there better ways to add code libraries to the model?</li>
<li>Some who have reviewed the concept for the registry suggested other attributes. Should these be added? (And what is missing?)
<ul>
<li>Package &ndash; Translations</li>
<li>Package &ndash; Intended audience (e.g. developers, patrons/desktop, patrons/web, library-staff/desktop, library-staff/web)</li>
<li>Version &ndash; Code maturity (e.g., alpha, beta, release candidate, formal release)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To answer the question &ldquo;Are any peers using this open source software?&rdquo; is it necessary to have an enumeration of library types? Public library, school library, university library, community college library, special library, museum (others?)</li>
<li>Is the location of Institutions and Providers desired? One reason it might be desirable is to do a geography-based search (e.g. training providers within a 60-mile radius).</li>
</ol>
<p>Feel free to add to the list of questions.  I'm looking forward to your thoughts.</p>
