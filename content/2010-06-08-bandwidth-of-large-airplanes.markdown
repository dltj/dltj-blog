  content: "Those are interesting numbers!\r\n\r\nI suppose it would be a little more
    complex to work in a single computer at one airport with a few million blu-ray
    drives burning, and the time and labor associated with loading the individual
    discs, burning the data, and packing the discs into jewel cases, etc. then another
    machine at the other end for a similar read operation. If the data were keyed
    the read order of the discs wouldn't necessarily be a hold-up for the read operation.\r\n\r\nNonetheless,
    that part would substantially diminish the figure. Sorry to be a downer. Guess
    it really depends on how you define bandwidth."

  content: 'Thanks for updating this comparison. Re Ryan''s comment: You''d need to
    know the cubic inches/ccs for a 2TB drive--and then make the comparison to spindles
    of Blu-ray discs (spindles still providing some protection and with less "waste"
    space). The comparison would, I''m sure, favor the 2TB drives (since one of them''s
    not as thick/heavy as 40 BDs), but perhaps not by a huge factor.'

  content: "@Brad -- yeah, I'm not under any illusion that someone would actually
    do this.  There are a whole bunch of other metrics that should be tested:\r\n<ul><li>can
    the aircraft hold the weight of all of the BluRay discs, carriers, and cardboard
    boxes?</li><li>what is the hardware and electrical cost of burning/reading the
    BluRay discs?</li><li>how much time does it take to load and unload the discs
    from the aircraft?</li></ul>\r\n\r\nAnd, as one could guess, the retransmission
    delay if one disc goes bad is a real bear...\r\n\r\n@Ryan -- I think you're right...2TB
    drives would be a higher density.  If no one gets to that, I might try a follow-up
    post when the mood strikes."

<p>Back in the early days of this blog, I had a post on <a href="/article/internet2-hopi-network/" title="DLTJ Blog Post: Buzzwords Galore and Bandwidth that May Rival Your Station Wagon">Buzzwords Galore and Bandwidth that May Rival Your Station Wagon</a>.  The topic was a "hybrid optical and packet network" being deployed by Internet2 in 2006, and in the tail end of the post text I explained the reference to the station wagon part of the post title:</p>
<blockquote><p> When you think you have a really zippy network connection, someone will (should?) bring up an <a href="http://www.bpfh.net/sysadmin/never-underestimate-bandwidth.html" title="Never underestimate the bandwidth....">old internet adage</a> which says &ldquo;Never underestimate the bandwidth of a station wagon full of tapes.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>In the post comments, Walt Crawford asked "How about a 747 full of BluRay discs?"  I must have been bored, because <a href="/article/internet2-hopi-network/#comment-2142">I calculated that bandwidth as 37Tb/s</a>, and I even showed my work.  Last week an internet citizen going by the name "Steveo" <a href="/article/internet2-hopi-network/#comment-72083">updated the table</a> for an <a href="http://www.aerospace-technology.com/projects/airbus_a380/" title="Airbus A380-800F Wide-Bodied Freighter">Airbus A38-800F</a>.  He (or she) and I arrived at different numbers (Steveo seems to have mistaken cubic feet for cubic meters in the calculation and didn't update the maximum airspeed figure), so perhaps it is time to revisit this topic.  (And while we're at it, we'll throw in numbers for Boeing's latest freighter aircraft: the 747-8F.)</p>

It also assumes that your can fit rectangular-shaped cartons in a cargo space that is clearly curved while still maximizing space.  Check my math and let me know if I made a mistake.</p>
<p>Now, by contrast, the latest notice I could find of high-speed data transfer over a network was a mention in December last year.  In a press release from Caltech with the title "<a href="http://media.caltech.edu/press_releases/13309" title="High Energy Physicists Set New Record for Network Data Transfer -  Caltech">High Energy Physicists Set New Record for Network Data Transfer</a>" is this paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>The focus of the exhibit was the [High Energy Physics] team's record-breaking demonstration of storage-to-storage data transfer over wide area networks from two racks of servers and a network switch-router on the exhibit floor [of SuperComputing 2009 in Portland, Oregon]. The high-energy physics team's demonstration, "Moving Towards Terabit/Sec Transfers of Scientific Datasets: The LHC Challenge," achieved a bidirectional peak throughput of 119 gigabits per second (Gbps) and a data flow of more than 110 Gbps that could be sustained indefinitely among clusters of servers on the show floor and at Caltech, Michigan, San Diego, Florida, Fermilab, Brookhaven, CERN, Brazil, Korea, and Estonia.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, 110 Gbps from a network and 217,648 Gbps from a Boeing 747-8 Freighter.  (We're not counting yet the capacity of the theoretical Airbus A380-800F.) Only three orders of magnitude before the proverbial station wagon full of tapes is put to rest.</p>
