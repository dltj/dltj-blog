  content: Hmm. Rather than OCLC, how about OpenLibrary as a central (and open and
    trusted) repository of social data about bibliographic entities? This is what
    I proposed at the end of my CouchDB talk at code4lib 2008 (slides at http://coffeecode.net/archives/151-CouchDB-delicious-sacrilege.html
    - see slide 23).

  content: Good point, Dan.  I forgot about your Code4Lib presentation.  One of the
    key points that I see to make this happen is a global identifier to tie things
    together.  OpenLibrary's identifier works as well as the OCLC number in this respect,
    I think -- particularly for contemporary materials.

  content: "Peter - thanks for your support.   A couple of things:\r\n\r\n1.  I often
    find librarians are very hesitant to criticize OCLC direct.  They seem afraid
    of alienating the behemoth and suffering for it.  But close the door for a conversation
    with a more neutral party and they unload.  So I'm not surprised at the disparity
    in the take-aways from both sets of conversations.\r\n\r\n2.  The new value I'm
    talking about being added is not restricted to \"bibliographic\" metadata.  In
    fact, I'm envisioning support for a far more encompassing definition of metadata
    (for all types of objects found on the Web).   In order for users to see libraries
    as important portals, I think we must reach beyond traditional bibliographic descriptions
    so that all types of information are ranked/evaluated and those evaluations forced
    up the tree of authentication/appropriateness/authority envisioned in my description.\r\n\r\nFinally,
    I don't want to propose my ideas as any kind of final vision, more just as some
    concepts to get a larger conversation started that I feel is long overdue in this
    profession."

  content: "I think you are right, Carl.  Could this be a(nother) sign of an entity
    that is \"too big to fail?\"  \r\n\r\nBigger than bibliographic data is probably
    automatically bigger than Open Library (and maybe even WorldCat -- it sort of
    depends on how you count the index/abstract records loaded into WorldCat).  \r\n\r\nThe
    concept certainly is a conversation starter.  I hope others add to the conversation,
    too."

<p>Within the span of a recent week we've had two views of the OCLC cooperative.  In one we have a proposition that OCLC has gone astray from its core roots and in the other a celebration of what OCLC can do.  One proposes a new mode of cooperation while the other extols the virtues of the existing cooperative.  Both writers claim -- independently -- to "talk to librarians" and represent the prevailing mood of the profession.  Can these two viewpoints be reconciled?</p>
<h2>"Too Many Cooks?"</h2>
<p>The pro-establishment view first.  In a <a href="http://community.oclc.org/cooperative/2010/09/too-many-cooks.html" title="Too many cooks? - The OCLC Cooperative Blog">post</a> by <a href="http://www.oclc.org/speakers/bios/nilges_chip.htm" title="William &039;Chip&039; Nilges [OCLC]">Chip Nilges</a> on the <a href="http://community.oclc.org/cooperative/" title="The OCLC Cooperative Blog: Insights and information from OCLC staff on topics that are fundamental to your cooperative.">OCLC Cooperative Blog</a>, we get the view that the backing of the wider librarian community is key to OCLC being able to <a href="http://www.oclc.org/news/releases/2010/201049.htm" title="H.W. Wilson databases indexed in WorldCat Local [OCLC]">negotiate with content vendors like H.W. Wilson</a>.  Chip's "talk to librarians" quote is:<br />
<blockquote>I spend quite a bit of time talking both to librarians and industry partners--publishers, booksellers, Web-technology providers, search engine companies--all kinds of people doing interesting things in our space. And in those talks, there is often a discussion of one of the following: content, technology or community. What I've come to realize, though, is that the best results come from places where all three come together.</p></blockquote>
<p>  Chip's post is short but clear in its view that the community of OCLC members is something special and that it adds value to member libraries.</p>
<h2>"The Cooperative We Need"</h2>
<p>The other perspective comes from <a href="http://www.exlibrisgroup.com/?catid=%7B795BD8B6-47DE-4722-8D5D-B664EEEFB34C%7D" title="Bio: Carl Grant">Carl Grant</a> in a <a href="http://thoughts.care-affiliates.com/2010/09/cooperative-we-need-open-collaborative.html" title="The cooperative we need: Open &amp; Collaborative Library Content">post</a> on his <a href="http://thoughts.care-affiliates.com/" title="Commentary from Carl Grant">Ex Libris blog</a>.  His thesis is that OCLC has an important role to play in adding value to bibliographic data, but that its motives are too intertwined with for-profit interests to carry out this role effectively.  Carl's "talk to librarians" quote is:<br />
<blockquote>It appears to me that the interests of the OCLC we know today do not appear to be in total alignment with the needs and interests of its overall actual membership. Perhaps they are in alignment with the interests of the Board, Council, and other governing and administrative arms, but the feeling I get in talks with librarians is that it is not in alignment with what they want. As I talk to librarians, across the country today, I hear that what they want is an organization, a cooperative that is focused on developing and providing open and collaborative library content and services that are widely accessible by all in order that they (the librarians) can focus on re-establishing and/or maintaining the value of libraries in our society.</p></blockquote>
<p> Carl goes on to propose the creation of a utility that aggregates the ratings and rankings of individual users into a database that can enhance the relevance ranking of the emerging generation of discovery layer products.</p>
<h2>My Thoughts</h2>
<p>This "talk to librarians" thread through the two posts makes me reflect on a question I asked earlier on <i><acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester">DLTJ</acronym></i>:  <a href="/article/oclc-social-contract/" title="What Does It Mean to Be a Member of OCLC? | Disruptive Library Technology Jester">"What Does it Mean to be a Member of OCLC?"</a>  Although I probably haven't talked to nearly the number of librarians as Chip and Carl, in my discussions within the profession I still haven't come to a resolution to this basic question.  That question itself is tied to another question coming through in the contrast between these two posts:  What Do We Want From OCLC?  </p>
<p>Carl describes the problem in his post.  When a not-for-profit vendor acquires a significant number of for-profit companies (and spins them back out again), how can we (members, vendors, and the library community in general) understand how the mix of commercial and non-commercial interests are playing out at the management level?  Can the OCLC that is the bibliographic utility, the metadata <a href="http://orweblog.oclc.org/archives/001611.html" title="Platforming a library network: destination and switch - Lorcan Dempsey's Weblog">switch</a> between bibliographic-based services, and the <acronym title="Research and Development">R&D</acronym> braintrust co-exist with the for-profit businesses, motivations, and operations?  Or, to put it more sharply, does the negotiation of H.W. Wilson content for use on the subscription-based WorldCat database hinder the evolution of discovery layers that being developed by companies that don't have the tax-advantaged not-for-profit status?  (And don't forget about the allegations of anti-competitive behavior in the <a href="http://www.librarytechnology.org/web/breeding/skyriver-vs-oclc/" title="http://www.librarytechnology.org/web/breeding/skyriver-vs-oclc/">SkyRiver/Innovative-versus-OCLC lawsuit</a>.)</p>
<p>In closing this section, I want to pull out and emphasize another quotation from Carl's post:<br />
<blockquote>In the end, all of these business initiatives, and now resulting lawsuit, strongly work against OCLC being able to do what it does best&mdash;building collaboration, content, and related services as a non-profit entity to serve the larger profession.</p></blockquote>
<p> Agreed.</p>
<h2>Carl's Grand Idea</h2>
<p>What might get lost if you only closely read the first half of Carl's post -- as it initially did for me -- is the second half where he describes the concept for enhancing WorldCat in a manner that benefits all...both library members and commercial entities.  He does this by noting that the "valuable points of open source software" can be applied -- in a social media fashion -- to a service that aggregates usage, ratings, and comments in a way that advances relevance ranking of discovery tools.  Now initially the mind swirls with concerns of privacy and informed user consent in gathering this data in one central pool.  I don't think we know enough yet in the library community about building privacy-robust systems that meet an American librarian's information privacy ethos.  But done right it also has the ability to build a reputation-based social feedback loop that adds important new information to the bibliographic utility.  And because of its better-when-bigger characteristic, only a neutral party like the not-for-profit OCLC cooperative could serve as an aggregator and distributor of this data.</p>
<p>I highly recommend reading <a href="http://thoughts.care-affiliates.com/2010/09/cooperative-we-need-open-collaborative.html" title="The cooperative we need: Open &amp; Collaborative Library Content">Carl's post</a> and thinking about ways of answering the question "What Do We Want From OCLC?"  I commend Carl for his courage and vision in articulating his points and proposing something new for the profession to drive towards.
