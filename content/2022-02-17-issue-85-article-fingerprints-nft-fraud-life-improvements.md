## Privacy-busting Fingerprints in Journal Articles
{: #fingerprinting-pdfs}


{% include thursday-threads-quote.html
blockquote='One of the world’s largest publishers of academic papers said it adds a unique fingerprint to every PDF users download in an attempt to prevent ransomware, not to prevent piracy. 

Elsevier defended the practice after an independent researcher discovered the existence of the unique fingerprints and shared their findings on Twitter last week. 

“The identifier in the PDF helps to prevent cybersecurity risks to our systems and to those of our customers—there is no metadata, PII [Personal Identifying Information] or personal data captured by these,” an Elsevier spokesperson said in an email to Motherboard. “Fingerprinting in PDFs allows us to identify potential sources of threats so we can inform our customers for them to act upon. This approach is commonly used across the academic publishing industry.”

When asked what risks he was referring to, the spokesperson sent a list of links to news articles about ransomware.'

Pretty incredulous...adding unique identifiers to the metadata of each PDF downloaded from Elsevier (the "fingerprint") somehow protects against ransomware. 
Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof, and it is not forthcoming from Elsevier. 
I've seen no follow-ups from Elsevier on this Motherboard article, nor from the researcher that {% include robustlink.html href="https://twitter.com/json_dirs/status/1486120144141123584" versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20220212021821/https://www.richdevelops.dev/blog/keeping-secrets-out-of-git" versiondate="2022-02-16" title="Tweet from json_dirs" anchor="discovered the fingerprinting" %}. 
Look, if you're employing a technique to go after researchers sharing PDFs of articles, own up to it. 
I can see why you don't want to, Elsevier...shared articles might cut into that $40-per-article charge you put on non-subscribers. 
Either way...owning it or lying about it looks bad. 
I can think of no plausible scenario where fingerprints in PDF files detect, prevent, or help prosecute ransomware.

## Fraud in NFTs

{% include thursday-threads-quote.html
blockquote='[Cameron] Hejazi highlighted three main problems: people selling unauthorised copies of other NFTs [Non-Fungible Tokens], people making NFTs of content which does not belong to them, and people selling sets of NFTs which resemble a security.

He said these issues were "rampant", with users "minting and minting and minting counterfeit digital assets".

"It kept happening. We would ban offending accounts but it was like we&#39;re playing a game of whack-a-mole... Every time we would ban one, another one would come up, or three more would come up."'

This from the company that "sells tweets": <quot>"The U.S.-based Cent executed one of the first known million-dollar NFT sales when it sold the former Twitter CEO's tweet as an NFT last March."</quot> 
Cent seems to be recognized by Twitter with some kind of legitimacy to sell NFTs of tweets. 
At least to the extent that the CEO of Twitter {% include robustlink.html href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1374071729467707394" versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20220129214521/https://twitter.com/jack/status/1374071729467707394" versiondate="2022-02-16" title="Tweet from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey" anchor="acknowledged the sale of the tweet" %}. 
But with everything NFTs, what is it that you are really selling, and is there any way of preventing someone from selling the exact same thing? 

Late-breaking addition: on Tuesday, {% include robustlink.html href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-16/who-won-the-melania-trump-nft-auction-trump-crypto-wallet-linked-to-185k-funds" versiondate="2022-02-16" title="Money That Won Melania Trump NFT Came From Melania Trump Wallet | Bloomberg News" anchor="Bloomberg News reported" %} that the winning bid for Melania Trump's NFT came from a cryptocurrency address traced back to the entity that put the item up for sale.

It was a fascinating, thought-provoking look at how technology has infiltrated our lives and what the current trajectory might hold. 
Topics that made me think...when was the last time I "logged on"? 
I mean, I'm constantly connected now. 
Was it when I replaced dial-up for a DSL connection? 
Was it when WiFi was added to the home? 
Was it when I got my first "smartphone"—a Windows CE device that had access to mobile internet? 
The gradual infusion (or, again, infiltration) of connectivity makes one wonder if some legitimate form of the "metaverse" is already here.
