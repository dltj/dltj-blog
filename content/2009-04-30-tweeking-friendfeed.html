<p><a href="http://friendfeed.com/" title="FriendFeed homepage">FriendFeed</a> went live yesterday with <a href="http://blog.friendfeed.com/2009/04/whole-new-friendfeed.html" title="Announcement of A whole new FriendFeed">changes to the user interface and back-end systems</a>.  The changes were moderately positive, taken as a whole, but there are aspects of the new user interface that I don't like -- the color scheme, the removal of the service icons, and the (over)-use of whitespace.  Fortunately, with Firefox plus a few extensions as my primary browser, I'm able to tweak the interface to be closer to my liking.  If your tastes resemble mine, I both feel sorry for you and want to help you improve your view of FriendFeed.<br />

<p>The primary tool to help with the user interface changes, in addition to using <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/" title="Get the Firefox Browser">Firefox</a>, is the <a href="http://www.greasespot.net/" title="Greasemonkey homepage">Greasemonkey</a> extension.  After <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748">installing this extension</a>, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090430204322/http://userscripts.org/about/installing" title="Installing Greasemonkey Scripts">you can use "scripts"</a> to tell the browser to change the HTML markup of any arbitrary web page as it is being loaded.  A secondary tool is the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/2108">Stylish extension</a>.  Stylish does to a pages CSS code what Greasemonkey does to the HTML -- it <a href="http://userstyles.org/help" title="User styles explained | userstyles.org">overrides the page author's styles and substitutes your own</a>.  Stylish is actually optional because you can use Greasemonkey to load a form of Stylish scripts to accomplish the same outcome.  (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090530/http://www.opera.com/browser/tutorials/userjs/examples/#greasemonkey" title="Opera: Tutorial - User Javascript">Some</a> Greasemonkey scripts also <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090530/http://www.opera.com/browser/tutorials/userjs/" title="Opera: Tutorial - User javascript">work</a> in the <a href="http://www.opera.com/browser/" title="Opera Web Browser">Opera browser</a>; I haven't tried the scripts listed here, so your mileage may vary.)</p>
<p>The first thing we want to do is bring back the service icons.  These are the 16x16 pixel graphics that show the source of the entry in the FriendFeed stream.  I haven't heard a good explanation from the FriendFeed developers as to why they took this out, but I find it to be a key factor in how I scan through the FriendFeed stream.  Fortunately, <a href="http://chrispeoples.com/" title="Chris Peoples' homepage">Chris Peoples</a> wrote a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090430204322/http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/46187" title="FriendFeed Service Icons for Greasemonkey">Greasemonkey script</a> to bring them back.  Simply <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090430204322/http://userscripts.org/scripts/source/46187.user.js" title="Greasemonkey script">install the script</a> and reload the FriendFeed page; the service icons will be back for public entries.  (As Chris notes, it doesn't work on private feed entries.)</p>
<p>The second thing we want to do is clean up the color scheme:  remove the grey background, de-emphasis the functional areas on the right, and rebalance the font sizes.  AJ Batac wrote a <a href="http://userstyles.org/styles/17424" title="Cleaner FriendFeed">Stylish script</a> that does that and more.  You can load this script into Stylish or apply the Greasemonkey version; as far as I know, they are equivalent.  In addition to the color schemes, this script adds new functionality:  highlighting friend comments in a light yellow background and highlighting your comments with a light blue background.  The latter is particularly useful for rescanning a conversation where you have made a comment; the light blue background tells you exactly where your comment is in the conversation and the new comments that followed.</p>
<p>There is a third script that removes the large avatars that came with the new interface design.  Personally, the avatar graphics don't bother me, but if you want to remove those, <a href="http://userstyles.org/styles/16763" title="Remove avatars from Friendfeed">you have that option</a>, too.</p>
