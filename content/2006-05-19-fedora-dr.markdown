<p>I think it is safe to say that most everyone favors using "fedora-dr" as a common tag for FEDORA(.info) activities.  If you want to take a stand on moral grounds, you can also tag your items as simply "fedora", but please also use the "fedora-dr" tag until we've gotten around to taking over more of the world.</p>
<p>This, of course, is just a recommendation from a loose confederation of self-selected interest users.  You can follow it or ignore it as you like.  Thanks to everyone who offered an opinion.</p>
