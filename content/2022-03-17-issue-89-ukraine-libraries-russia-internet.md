The first story below is one from National Public Radio on Ukraine libraries' efforts are undertaking. 
Let's not forget the terror they are facing, the people stepping up to meet their community's needs, and those who have lost their lives in the Russian war.

The threads this week:

I'm not surprised. 
I presume the libraries mentioned in the NPR article are "public libraries," but they could be libraries of any type. 
It brings to mind the stories about the {% include robustlink.html href="https://www.libraryjournal.com/story/2015-galelj-library-of-the-year-ferguson-municipal-public-library-mo-courage-in-crisis" versiondate="2022-03-16" title="2015 Gale/LJ Library of the Year: Ferguson Municipal Public Library, MO, Courage in Crisis | Library Journal" anchor="library in Ferguson" %}, Missouri, during the riots for the shooting of Michael Brown by local police. 
The NPR story also mentions Nicholas Poole's "we will reschedule just as soon as we have vanquished our invaders" tweet that was in [_Thursday Threads_ two weeks ago]({% post_url_absolute 2022-03-03-issue-87-ukraine-ai-art %}#ukraine-library-association).

## Can the Internet Sanction a Country? Should It?

blockquote='The invasion of Ukraine poses a new challenge for multistakeholder Internet infrastructure governance. In this statement, we discuss possible sanctions and their ramifications, lay out principles that we believe should guide Internet sanctions, and propose a multistakeholder governance mechanism to facilitate decision-making and implementation.'

Last week, {% include robustlink.html href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/03/ukraine-wants-russia-cut-off-from-core-internet-systems-experts-say-its-a-bad-idea/" versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20220310120301/https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/03/ukraine-wants-russia-cut-off-from-core-internet-systems-experts-say-its-a-bad-idea/" versiondate="2022-03-10" title="Ukraine asks ICANN to revoke Russian domains and shut down DNS root servers | Ars Technica" anchor="Ukraine's Ministry of Digital Transformation called on internet bodies to sanction Russia" %} over its government's war on Ukraine. 
This would include revoking Russia's top-level country domains (e.g. ".ru"), canceling SSL certificates associated with Russian sites, disabling the root DNS servers, and withdrawing the right for Russian internet service providers to use the IP addresses that have been assigned to the country. 
The _Multistakeholder Imposition of Internet Sanctions_ document describes why this would be a bad idea and lays out a plan for what can be done. 
For more depth, see the [article I wrote last week]({% post_url_absolute 2022-03-10-internet-sanctions %}) on the document.

## _Thursday Threads 2011_: The Demise of the Big Deal?
{: #thursday-threads-2011}
Looking backward, the _Thursday Threads_ for 17-Mar-2011 had an [entry for an interview by Richard Poynder](https://dltj.org/article/thursday-threads-2011w11/#big-deal) with a financial analyst that had a downgraded outlook of Reed Elsevier. 
A key quote: _"I can observe, however, that there is something unhealthy about an industry which has managed to alienate its customers to the point their membership associations increasingly focus time and attention on how to overturn the industry structure."_
I think it is fair to say that not much has changed.

{% include note.html notetext='After the newsletter was published, Richard <a href="https://twitter.com/RickyPo/status/1504434940573798411">tweeted</a>: "The Aspesi interview is worth comparing with the 2013 interview with Sami Kassab I think." The tweet included a link to <a href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/2013/10/media-research-analyst-at-exane-bnp.html" data-versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20220317124253/https://poynder.blogspot.com/2013/10/media-research-analyst-at-exane-bnp.html" data-versiondate="2022-03-17">his 6-Oct-2013 interview</a>.  About halfway down Richard&#039;s summary is a discussion about how reputation is a dominant factor in where authors choose to publish, which will favor the large, incumbent publishers.  Nearly 10 years later, it would seem that Mr. Kassab&#039;s prediction has held true.' %}

## This Week's Cats
{: #alan-mittens}
{% include image.html wpsrc="2022/2022-03-17-alan-mittens.jpg" float="right" width="320" alt="Photograph of a black and white cat sleeping in a curled-up ball on one side of a bed while a black cat looks lover from the other side of the bed." %} 

This is a throwback to a picture of Alan (left) and Mittens (right) from [six weeks ago]({% post_url_absolute 2022-02-03-issue-83-cdl-wwe-childrens-book %}#cat-fence). 
In that picture, there was a pillow fence between the two. 
This time? No fence!

So there is no reason why my two cats have to dominate the _Thursday Threads_ newsletter. 
Do you have a picture of a cat (your cat or a library cat) doing what cats do? 
(Which, as you can tell from my two lovable felines, is to be extraordinarily cute.) 
Tweet your picture to me or send it by email along with a brief bio, and I'll add your adorable pussycat to an upcoming newsletter.
