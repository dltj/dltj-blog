Inspired by Tom Whitwell's [52 things I learned in 2022](https://medium.com/magnetic/52-things-i-learned-in-2022-db5fcd4aea6e), I started my own list of things I learned in 2023. 
I got well into 2024 before I realized I hadn't published it! 
So, in no particular order:

1. In the summer of 2011, a lab technician at Los Alamos National Laboratory carefully laid 8 rods of plutonium on a bench to take a picture. The rods were almost close enough to cause an uncontrolled fission event.  {% include robustlink.html href="https://www.science.org/content/article/near-disaster-federal-nuclear-weapons-laboratory-takes-hidden-toll-america-s-arsenal" versionurl="https://web.archive.org/20221207041840/https://www.science.org/content/article/near-disaster-federal-nuclear-weapons-laboratory-takes-hidden-toll-america-s-arsenal" versiondate="2022-12-06" title="A near-disaster at a federal nuclear weapons laboratory takes a hidden toll on America's arsenal | Science" anchor="AAAS Science" %}
1. Runways are named by their magnetic compass heading value divided by 10 (e.g. a runway heading due east—90°—is named "runway 9"). Variations in the Earth's magnetic fields means that sometimes runways have to be renamed.  {% include robustlink.html href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/airport-runway-names-shift-magnetic-field" versionurl="https://web.archive.org/20221230190820/https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/airport-runway-names-shift-magnetic-field" versiondate="2022-12-30T14:08:12" title="Airport Runway Names Shift with Magnetic Field | National Centers for Environmental Information" anchor="National Centers for Environmental Information" %}
1. The impetus behind Google Image Search came from people searching for pictures of Jennifer Lopez in her blue/green dress at the 2000 Grammy Awards. {% include robustlink.html href="https://www.cnn.com/style/article/jlo-green-dress-grammys-remember-when" versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20230203190004/https://www.cnn.com/style/article/jlo-green-dress-grammys-remember-when" versiondate="2023-02-03" title="Remember when Jennifer Lopez's Grammy Awards dress helped invent Google Image Search? | CNN" anchor="CNN" %} 
1. The eucalypts tree drops oily leaves that eventually burn down the forest, but that kills off surface vegetation and is needed to open the eucalypt seed pods. {% include robustlink.html href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/25/greedflation/" versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20230425195947/https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/25/greedflation/" versiondate="2023-Apr-25" title="How Amazon makes everything you buy more expensive, no matter where you buy it | Pluralistic" anchor="Cory Doctorow's Pluralistic" %}
1. The origins of the nautical terms "port" side (because it was the side of the ship used for loading/unloading) and "starboard" side (from Old English for "steer" and "side of the boat"). {% include robustlink.html href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/port-starboard.html" versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20230515210818/https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/port-starboard.html" versiondate="2023-04-13" title="Why do ships use 'port' and 'starboard' instead of 'left' and 'right?' | NOAA National Ocean Service" anchor="NOAA National Ocean Service" %}

Not much in this first year, but I've already started a running list for 2024.
