  content: "<!--%kramer-pre%-->Gary Price: What can I say?  I certainly need to thank
    Joshua M. Neff and Jennifer Lang and Steve Oberg and Marlene Delhaye (merci!).
    \ Also thanks to DrWeb and Jennifer Macaulay and David Bigwood and Peter Murray.
    \ If I&rsquo;ve missed anyone (including people who may yet do posts!), my apologies&ndash;and
    my gratitude. (There&rsquo;s a phantom post from another Jennifer, but since the
    link yields a 404 I won&rsquo;t cite it here.)<!--%kramer-post%-->"

<p>Professor Eric Faden of Bucknell University demonstrates principles of fair use to give an overview of U.S. copyright principles in <a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/documentary-film-program/film/a-fair-y-use-tale" title="A Fair(y) Use Tale | Stanford Center for Internet and Society">A Fair(y) Use Tale</a> -- a 10-minute video in five acts.  Using clips from dozens of Disney films, Faden gives the historical perspective and underlying principles for copyright law in the United States.  This is a great conversation starter for discussions about changing copyright -- not only for its content, but also for its use of media from the very <a href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/?articleID=4031" title="Article from Digital Journal -- Copyright and the Mouse: How Disney&#039;s Mickey Mouse Changed the World">corporate interest</a> that has <a href="http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/08/10/cq/disney.html" title="Article from CNN.Com -- Disney In Washington: The Mouse That Roars">had a big hand</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_Bono_Copyright_Term_Extension_Act" title="Wikipedia article -- Copyright Term Extension Act">ongoing march towards indefinite copy rights</a>.  Wired Magazine's blog also has <a href="http://blog.wired.com/business/2007/05/hijacked_disney.html" title="Blog posting from Wired Blogs -- Hijacked Disney Characters Explain Copyright">a commentary on the video</a>.</p>
<p>Found via Walt Crawford's <a href="http://walt.lishost.org/?p=554" title="Blog posting from Walt at Random -- Fair(y) use: Brilliant">Walt At Random</a> posting.
