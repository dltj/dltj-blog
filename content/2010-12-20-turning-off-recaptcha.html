<p>I'm trying an experiment over the next couple days/weeks.  I'm turning off the reCAPTCHA requirement for blog commenters (the figure-out-these-words-and-type-them-in anti-spam scheme I <a href="/article/dltj-now-uses-recaptcha/">turned on three and a half years ago</a>).  The only automated scheme in place now is <a href="http://akismet.com/" title="Stop Comment Spam and Trackback Spam &amp;laquo; Akismet">Akismet</a>. This change was made Friday night, and over the weekend a few spam comments got through to "approved" status while 550 were in the "spam" queue.  With reCAPTCHA in place, I would typically only get 10 or so comments that would make it through reCAPTCHA only to get caught by Akismet (and none through to approved comments).  I could easily go through 10 or so comments a day looking for ones that would accidentally get trapped (maybe one a month), but I'm not going through 200 or more a day.  So, if you comment on <i><acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester">DLTJ</acronym></i> and don't see it immediately posted, please do let me know and I'll fetch it out of the spam queue.</p>
