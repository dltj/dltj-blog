<p>As part of our winter holiday activities, our family has been busily clearing out the basement to set up a play area for the kids.  In doing so, we created a stack of old electronics -- monitors, printers, stereo receivers, and such -- that are of questionable working condition and worth.  In looking around the web, I found the <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.swaco.org/SmartPeople/Disposal.aspx#computers">list of e-waste disposal locations</span> on the <acronym title="Solid Waste Authority of Central Ohio">SWACO</acronym> website.  Unfortunately, I couldn't tell which one was the closest because it was in a static list.  So with a little spare time I put them on a map to help me find the nearest location; hopefully it will help you find the nearest location as well.</p>

<p>If you know of any other locations, please add them in the comments and I'll update the map.</p>
<h2>Updates</h2>
<p><i>9-Jan-2008:</i>  Based on a <a href="http://dublinohiousa.gov/living/its-greener-in-dublin/" title="City of Dublin, Ohio - It&#039;s Greener in Dublin">listing at the city of Dublin</a> website, the <span class="removed_link" title="http://72.32.194.107/Default.aspx?tabid=4729">Volunteers of America Thrift Store locations</span> were added to the map.  Also, the Dublin website noted the Material Assistance Providers, Inc (MAPS) <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.mapfurniturebank.org/DonateFurniture.htm">free pickup service</span> for items such as TVs.  Also see the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/conserve/materials/ecycling/donate.htm" title="Where Can I Donate or Recycle My Old Computer and Other Electronic Products? | eCycling | US EPA">EPA's site for "eCycling" electronics</a>.
