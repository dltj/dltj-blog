<p>This week's <a href="/category/thursday-threads/"><i><acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester">DLTJ</acronym> Thursday Threads</i></a> has just two pointers.  First, a new volunteer <a href="#p2548-accessibility">web service to report problems with websites</a>, which may be useful for not only our own sites but for the sites our patrons visit.  Second, a <a href="#p2548-remix">nine-minute video</a> that illustrates the reuse of themes and ideas in motion pictures across time.</p>
<p>If you find these threads interesting and useful, you might want to add the <a href="http://feeds.dltj.org/thursday-threads/" title="RSS Feed for DLTJ Thursday Threads">Thursday Threads RSS Feed</a> to your feed reader or subscribe to e-mail delivery using the form to the right.  If you would like a more raw and immediate version of these types of stories, watch <a href="http://friendfeed.com/dltj" title="Peter Murray - FriendFeed">my FriendFeed stream</a> (or subscribe to <a href="http://friendfeed.com/dltj?format=atom" title="Atom feed for Peter Murray's FriendFeed account">its feed</a> in your feed reader).

<h2 id="p2548-accessibility">Addressing Accessibility, from Fix the Web</h2>
<blockquote><p>Web accessibility is not improving very quickly despite the efforts of many experts. The scale of the problem is huge and there is a need for culture change amongst web developers and website owners. </p>
<p>Our solution is to make it super easy for disabled and older people to report problems with websites. Volunteers do the work of contacting the website owners and signposting them to support. In doing this work, volunteers will understand more about e-accessibility for themselves, as well as giving crucial information to website owners. Everybody wins! </p>
<p>Details of how the process works are explained for the different roles (<a href="http://www.fixtheweb.net/being-volunteer" title="more about being a volunteer">volunteering</a> and <a href="http://www.fixtheweb.net/reporting-websites" title="information about reporting websites">issue reporter)</a> and in the <a href="http://www.fixtheweb.net/faq" title="frequently asked questions">FAQs.</a> </p>
<p>You can get involved in three different ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.fixtheweb.net/reporting-websites" title="Information about reporting websites">Report issues</a> you are having with websites.</li>
<li><span class="removed_link" title="http://www.fixtheweb.net/more-about-being-volunteer">Volunteer</span> to help liaise with website owners.</li>
<li>Support the development of the project: <a href="http://www.fixtheweb.net/contact" title="Contact | Fix the Web">contact the coordinator</a>. </li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>This <a href="http://www.fixtheweb.net/" title="Addressing accessibility | Fix the Web">project</a> intersects with libraries in two ways.  First, we must make sure our websites are available to all populations -- including users browsing the web with alternate (large screen, color neutral, and/or audio-driven) browsers.  (If this intersection is of interest to you, then check out the 1-hour webinar from Infopeople on an <a href="http://www.infopeople.org/training/webcasts/webcast_data/502/index.html" title="title - Infopeople.org">ADA Update: Revised Regulations for Disability Accommodations for the Public</a>.)  The second place it might intersect with libraries is assisting patrons browsing the web.  Although reporting a site won't fix it for that patron, if it is a common site for your patrons then <a href="http://www.fixtheweb.net/reporting-websites" title="Information about reporting websites">reporting the issue</a> will <a href="http://www.fixtheweb.net/being-volunteer" title="more about being a volunteer">engage</a> a group of volunteers that can help site owners fix the accessibility problems.</p>
<h2 id="p2548-remix">Everything is a Remix Part 2</h2>
<blockquote><p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/19447662" width="400" height="225" frameborder="0"></iframe><br />An exploration of the remix techniques involved in producing films. Part Two of a four-part series.</p></blockquote>
<p>Where did George Lucas get ideas for Star Wars? <a href="http://vimeo.com/19447662" title="Everything is a Remix Part 2 on Vimeo">Watch this 9 minute video</a> that shows side-by-side comparisons of Star Wars with movies that the creator of this video says were Lucas' sources.  The creator also describes other examples of ideas and images are drawn through film.  This video is the <a href="http://www.everythingisaremix.info/?p=58" title="Everything is a Remix Part 2 | Everything Is a Remix">second part</a> (and latest available) of an eventual <a href="http://www.everythingisaremix.info/?page_id=30" title="Watch | Everything Is a Remix">four-part series</a>.
