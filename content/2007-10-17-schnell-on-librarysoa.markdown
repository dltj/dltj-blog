<p>Back in June, Eric Schnell posted a five part introduction to applying Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) concepts to library applications.  Along with his <a href="http://ericschnell.blogspot.com/2006/10/what-do-henry-ford-and-online-catalog.html" title="What Do Henry Ford and the Online Catalog Have In Common?">comparison of the predominant ILS architecture with Henry Ford's application of assembly line manufacturing</a> this is a great non-techie introduction to SOA form a library application perspective.  I had reason to run across these again earlier this month and remembered that I had not posted a summary and pointers here.</p>
<p><a href="http://ericschnell.blogspot.com/2007/06/service-oriented-library-systems-part.html" title="The Medium is the Message: Service-Oriented Library Systems Pt.1: Introduction">Part 1 is an introduction</a> with a brief overview of why SOA is interesting.  <a href="http://ericschnell.blogspot.com/2007/06/service-oriented-library-systems-pt-2.html" title="The Medium is the Message: Service Oriented Library Systems Pt. 2: What We Have Today">Part 2 is a description of the silos</a> of content that exist today which in <a href="http://ericschnell.blogspot.com/2007/07/service-oriented-library-systems-pt-3.html" title="The Medium is the Message: Service Oriented Library Systems Pt. 3: Where Are We Heading?">part 3 Eric describes how the silos can be collapsed</a> and the structure of services that surround them.  <a href="http://ericschnell.blogspot.com/2007/07/service-oriented-library-systems-pt-4.html" title="The Medium is the Message: Service Oriented Library Systems Pt. 4: Challenges">Part 4 describes the challenges</a> of doing this from the vendor lock-in that makes is financially not viable for SOA-based solutions to break into the space.  In <a href="http://ericschnell.blogspot.com/2007/07/service-oriented-library-systems-pt-5.html" title="The Medium is the Message: Service-Oriented Library Systems Pt. 5: Final Comments">part 5 Eric offers some final comments</a> on the introduction of SOA into library applications.</p>
<p>Well worth reading and bookmarking for future reference.  Nice job, Eric!</p>
