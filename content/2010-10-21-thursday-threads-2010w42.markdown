<h2>Defining Linked Data By Analogy</h2>
<blockquote><p>RDF is the grammar for a language of data.  URIs are the words of that language.  As in natural language, these words (i.e., the URIs) belong to grammatical categories.  RDF properties (such as "isReferencedBy") function a bit like verbs, RDF classes like nouns.</p>
<p>As in natural languages, where utterances are meaningful only if they follow a sentence grammar, RDF statements follow a simple and consistent three-part grammar of subject, predicate, and object.  Analogously to paragraphs, RDF statements are aggregated into RDF graphs.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-lld/2010Oct/0088.html" title="Good grammar and proper footnotes for data from Thomas Baker on 2010-10-18 (public-lld@w3.org from October 2010)">posting from Thomas Baker</a> on the <acronym title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</acronym> Library Linked Data exploratory group mailing list. It compares <acronym title="Resource Description Framework">RDF</acronym> to natural languages using analogies of grammar, words, sentences, and paragraphs. I think this is a useful way to think about RDF and linked data, although as initial introduction to the topic, you might want to see the presentation below.</p>
<h2>RDF For Librarians presentation recording</h2>
<blockquote><p>The RDF model underlying Semantic Web technologies is frequently described as the future of structured metadata. Its adoption in libraries has been slow, however. This is due in no small part to fundamental differences in the modeling approach that RDF takes, representing a "bottom up" architecture where a description is distributed and can be made up of any features deemed necessary, whereas the record-centric approach taken by libraries tends to be more "top down" relying on prespecified feature sets that all should strive to make the best use of. This presentation will delve deeply into the differences between these two approaches to explore why the RDF approach has proven difficult for libraries, look at some RDF-based initiatives that are happening in libraries and how they are allowing different uses of this metadata than was previously possible, and pose some questions about how libraries might best.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jenn Riley gave this hour-long presentation to the Indiana University Digital Library Brown Bag earlier this month.  The URL to the slides synchronized to the audio recording is <a href="http://breeze.iu.edu/p48776227/" title="Digital Library Brown Bag, RDF for Librarians, 9/22/2010">http://breeze.iu.edu/p48776227/</a>.  The <a href="http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/education/brownbags/fall2010/rdf/rdf.pdf" title="Digital Library Brown Bag, RDF for Librarians presentation slides, 9/22/2010">presentation slides</a> and the <a href="http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/education/brownbags/fall2010/rdf/rdfhandout.pdf" title="Digital Library Brown Bag, RDF for Librarians presentation handout, 9/22/2010">handout</a> from the session are available as well.  I highly recommend spending an hour with this presentation to learn about how linked data compares and contrasts with MARC records.

<h2>The Future of the Federal Depository Libraries</h2>
<blockquote><p>[ProPublica's Dafna] Linzer's expose of government tampering with a court docket is an example of the problem on which the LOCKSS Program has been working for more than a decade, how to make the digital record resistant to tampering and other threats. The only reason this case was detected was because Linzer created and kept a copy of the information the government published, and this copy was not under their control. Maintaining copies under multiple independent administrations (i.e. not all under control of the original publisher) is a fundamental requirement for any scheme that can recover from tampering (and in practice from many other threats).</p></blockquote>
<p>David Rosenthal <a href="http://blog.dshr.org/2010/10/future-of-federal-depository-libraries.html" title="DSHR's Blog: The Future of the Federal Depository Libraries">summarizes</a> a story about how a published document from the U.S. government was changed and why we need highly-distributed copies of government documents to detect and recover from tampering.  There are big implications here for the future of government documents depository programs.</p>
<h2>ProPublica&rsquo;s Guide to Mechanical Turk</h2>
<blockquote><p>Amazon Mechanical Turk &ndash; or mTurk &ndash; is an online marketplace, set up by the online shopping site Amazon, where anyone can hire workers to complete short, simple tasks over the Internet. Amazon originally developed it as an in-house tool, and commercialized it in 2005. The mTurk workforce now numbers more than 100,000 workers in 200 countries, according to Amazon. At ProPublica, we use it for tasks like collecting, reformatting, and de-duplicating data. This is a guide to journalists looking to use Mechanical Turk in their data projects. It&rsquo;s meant for users who are already familiar with mTurk and are looking for ways to improve their results.</p></blockquote>
