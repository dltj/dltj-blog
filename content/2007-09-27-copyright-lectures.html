<div class="description">How can the university foster intellectual exploration and creativity, protect students' privacy, and educate responsible citizens of the networked world? Is it possible to support balanced copyright law and enforcement, without responding to every entertainment company's demands for internet filtering and "pre-litigation notices"?</p>

<p>It looks like previous talks from the <a class="url" href="http://ucpl.cornell.edu/" title="Cornell University Computer Policy and Law Program (UCPL)">Cornell University Computer Policy and Law Program</a> are archived at the same website, so if you miss Professor Seltzer's talks today you can catch them another day.</p>
<p>[Update 20070927T1230 : Fixed the ending dates in the hCalendar microformat markup.  Sorry 'bout that.]
