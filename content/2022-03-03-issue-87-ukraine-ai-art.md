We are one week into Russia's war against Ukraine. 
From here in America, it is hard to understand the reality of a country whose citizens seemed to be going about normal lives just a short time ago. 
I find it also hard to know what to say to people whose misery comes about on the whims of a dictator guided by...what? 
A misguided notion of history? 
A deep-seated desire to return to former glory? 
A vain attempt to show how big his manhood is? 

Who can tell? 
Beyond asking my elected officials to *do something* and tweeting expressions of support, I'm feeling powerless to change what is happening. 
I hope and pray for a return to sanity, for grace and mercy for those in conflict, and for a world that strives to find a greater, common good.

blockquote='Dear colleagues,
The sneaky, cruel and bloody aggression of the Russian Federation has prevented us from implementing our plans and holding March 1-4 XII International Scientific Conference "Modern Library-Information Continuous Education: what, how, for whom? ".
65 participants registered at the conference, re-calculated the registration fee of 35 members of the VGO Ukrainian Library Association total amount of 10 500 UAH.
The Organizing Committee of the Conference has decided to hold the Conference after our confident victory, and the contributions collected to support the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
We promise to provide complete and quality service to all participants in the peaceful time.
Glory to Ukraine!
For questions, please contact the Executive Office of the Association by email.'

Nicholas Poole, CEO of CILIP in the UK, has a poetic take on this announcement from the Ukraine Library Association. 
Facebook's automated translation from Ukrainian to English (quoted above) sounds a little dry; I'm left wondering how this reads in the original Ukrainian.

In comparison with previous wars, this Russia's war with Ukraine will have a lot of primary sources. 
In the near term, people need to figure out what is real and what is manipulated. 
For our future selves, though, historians will need the video, photographs, and texts of the people in this war and those that are touched by it. 
I'm grateful for the people whose first instinct is to save-the-now so that source material is available.

It looks pretty—greens and purples, a bed of rails curving into the distance. 
To my eye, it looks like art—it is something I would hang on a  wall (or make into a video screen background). 
But the copyright office has ruled that it cannot be registered as a copyrighted work.
