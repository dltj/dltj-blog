    use two (or more!) literary sources to come up with titles and brief descriptions
    for possible literary mash-ups and send them to us. We&rsquo;ll post as many as
    possible of the ones that make us laugh the hardest on this website in about a
    week. We&rsquo;ll consider posting entire flash fiction pieces, as well.\"\r\n\r\nThe

    is more or less a birthday gift to myself. I've been drawing it on every page
    of Moby Dick (using two books to get both sides of each page) for months. The
    soundtrack is built from searching \"moby dick\" on You Tube (I was looking for
    Orson's Preacher from the the John Huston film), I couldn't find the preacher,
    but did find tons of Led Zep and drummers doing Bonzo and a little Orson reading
    from the Novel for a failed Italian T.V. film...... makes for a nice Melville
    in the end.\"\r\n\r\nOr in HD at http://vimeo.com/604918\r\n\r\n\"A mash up of
    Orson Welles reading Moby Dick drawn in the pages of Moby Dick with Led Zep and
    John Bonham playing Moby Dick... with some Champagne thrown in for good measure.\""

<p>I'm working with some colleagues at the Library of Congress on the on the description of complex analog and digital resources.  In that research, we want to get a better sense of what people who read <acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester"><i>DLTJ</i></acronym> call a &ldquo;mash-up.&rdquo;  We invite readers to provide examples (in any medium) of what they think are mash-ups of different resources in the <a href="/article/mash-up-request-for-submissions/#respond">comment area of this post</a>. If you nominate a web-accessible mash-up, please provide a link for it. If you nominate an analog mash-up (they do exist!), please provide a reasonable citation. If it is a hybrid &ndash; do your best! Also helpful would be a short statement as to why you think the example is a mash-up, and whether you like the results.<br />
<!--more--><br />
The research involves how we describe the parts of a whole guided by concepts provided by <acronym title="Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records">FRBR</acronym>.  These sorts of mashups are typically made up of independently created parts, and acknowledging those parts are in single-record frames of reference.  We're exploring the use of interconnected networks of descriptions, and mashups are one of the exemplars.</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>We're looking for mixtures of audio, still images, moving images, and other media.</p>
