<p> Update 20071227T1147 : Title of the post changed to reflect the certainty of the bill being signed into law.

<p>The U.S. House and Senate have agreed on <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:h.r.02764:" title="THOMAS (Library of Congress) entry for H.R. 2764 in the 110th Congress">a Consolidated Appropriations Act</a> that includes the NIH mandatory deposit and open access provision <a href="/article/nih-public-access/">discussed on <acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester"><i>DLTJ</i></acronym> previously</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>SEC. 218. The Director of the National Institutes of Health shall require that all investigators funded by the NIH submit or have submitted for them to the National Library of Medicine's PubMed Central an electronic version of their final, peer-reviewed manuscripts upon acceptance for publication, to be made publicly available no later than 12 months after the official date of publication: Provided, That the NIH shall implement the public access policy in a manner consistent with copyright law.</p></blockquote>
<p>The text is unchanged from the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:H.R.3043:" title="THOMAS (Library of Congress) entry for H.R. 3043 in the 110th Congress">previous version of the bill</a>, which was vetoed by the president last month.  According to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/18/AR2007121802332.html" title="&#039;Iraq Funds Approved In Senate Budget Bill&#039; in the Washington Post">an article on the front page of today's Washington Post</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/19/washington/19spend.html?ex=1355806800&#038;en=0305d907aec3184b&#038;ei=5124&#038;partner=permalink&#038;exprod=permalink" title="&#039;Senate Adds $70 Billion for Wars in Spending Bill&#039 in the New York Times"> an article in the New York Times</a>, the final steps of the bill are consideration by the House of an unrestricted war funds amendment, where passage is likely, followed by an expected signature by the President.</p>
