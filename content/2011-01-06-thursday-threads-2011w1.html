<p>The turn of the year brings commentary on the past 12 months and thoughts on the future.  This edition of <i><acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester">DLTJ</acronym> Thursday Threads</i> looks at the relationship between libraries and electronic books with an offer by Sony to explain e-reader hardware to libraries and an opinion piece that libraries need to get their act together on the adoption of e-books.  Then there is a look forward at possible trends for the new year; I try to pick out the ones that I think will have an impact on libraries.  One trend that does seem to be emerging is the migration of libraries from proprietary software to open source software for their integrated library systems.  Lastly, we'll wrap up with a look at Public Domain Day.</p>
<p>If you find these threads interesting and useful, you might want to add the <a href="http://feeds.dltj.org/thursday-threads/">Thursday Threads RSS Feed</a> to your feed reader or subscribe to e-mail delivery using the form to the right.  If you would like a more raw and immediate version of these types of stories, watch <a href="http://friendfeed.com/dltj" title="Peter Murray - FriendFeed">my FriendFeed stream</a> (or subscribe to <a href="http://friendfeed.com/dltj?format=atom" title="Atom feed for Peter Murray's FriendFeed account">its feed</a> in your feed reader).  Comments and tips, as always, are welcome.</p>
<h2><a name="sony_ereader">The Changing Role of Libraries in the Digital Age</a></h2>
<blockquote><p>At Sony, we believe there is a place for public/private partnerships.  That's why we're so excited to be working closely with libraries and librarians across the country as part of our <a href="http://ebookstore.sony.com/library-program/" title="Sony Reader Library Program">Reader Library Program</a>. While there are several different views on the future of libraries, we believe that digital reading will be at the core of libraries, regardless of how they grow and evolve.  </p>
<p>Sony's Reader Library Program is designed to help libraries overcome the challenges of adopting eBooks and educating their constituencies on how to borrow, read and make the most of digital reading content.   eBooks, like traditional paper books, will play an important role in our civic and cultural life, but only if they are made broadly available and people understand how to access and use them. </p></blockquote>
<p>Steve Haber, President of Sony&rsquo;s Digital Reading Business, publishes this <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steve-haber/the-changing-role-of-libr_b_803722.html" title="Steve Haber: The Changing Role of Libraries in the Digital Age | The Huffington Post">piece in the Huffington Post</a> about the <a href="http://ebookstore.sony.com/library-program/" title="Sony Reader Library Program">Sony Reader Library Program</a>.  The program offers a 2-3 hour training session for library staff, donation of four models of Sony e-reader devices for library staff use, promotional materials for patrons and "bi-annual update sessions designed to keep libraries and their staff current with the latest developments in digital reading content, format and devices."  Although I found out about this via a <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ALA_PLA/status/22339287420764161" title="Tweet from ALA_PLA">tweet from the ALA PLA account</a>, I don't see anything in the program description that limits it to public libraries.  The only requirement is that the "library must have eBooks available through a third party such as www.overdrive.com in order to be considered for our program."</p>
<p>I also can't help but be a bit cynical that "The Changing Role of Libraries in the Digital Age" is just a front to promote Sony products.  But if it gets more libraries thinking about the role of libraries in a digital age, then it seems to be, on balance, a positive thing.</p>
<h2><a name="libraries_screwed">2010 Summary: Libraries are Still Screwed</a></h2>
<blockquote><p>In mathematics, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catastrophe_theory" title="Catastrophe theory | Wikipedia">catastrophe theory</a> is the study of nonlinear dynamical systems which exhibit points or curves of singularity. The behavior of systems near such points is characterized by sudden and dramatic changes resulting from even very small perturbations. The simplest sort of catastrophe is the fold catastrophe.</p>
<p>When a fold catastrophe occurs, a system that was formerly characterized by a single stable point evolves to a system with no stability. The point where stability disappears is known as the tipping point.</p>
<p>One of my goals for this past year was to raise awareness of the tipping point for libraries that will accompany the obsolescence of the print book.</p></blockquote>
<p>Eric Hellman, serial entrepreneur with an altruistic bent to make libraries stay relevant, create this <a href="http://go-to-hellman.blogspot.com/2010/12/2010-summary-libraries-are-still.html" title="2010 Summary: Libraries are Still Screwed | Go To Hellman">end-of-2010 summary of the library/ebook tensions</a>.  The title comes from a presentation (20 minute recording <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqAwj5ssU2c" title="Eli Neiburger at the LJ/SLJ eBook Summit: Libraries Are Screwed, Part 1 | YouTube">part 1</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd0lIKVstJg" title="Eli Neiburger at the LJ/SLJ eBook Summit: Libraries are Screwed, Unless... Part 2 | YouTube">part 2</a>) by Eli Neiburger at the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20101102201746/http://ebook-summit.com/program/" title="Ebooks: Libraries at the Tipping Point">Library Journal / School Library Journal eBook Summit</a> who bluntly states, "Libraries are Screwed."</p>
<p>Does the libraries' historic reliance on the physical codex doom us to obsolescence?  (The "library memorial", as Eli puts it early in his presentation.)  Is the time, as Eric suggests at the end of his post, "for raising awareness about the catastrophic future of libraries" over, to be replaced by "build[ing] things that change the system dynamics"?</p>

<blockquote><p>As part of our annual forecast, JWT presents 100 Things to Watch in 2011. Some of the items on our list reflect broader shifts we&rsquo;ve been following:</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Mobile as the Everything Hub: More consumers and brands are embracing a trend we outlined two years ago, one that will manifest in a multitude of ways next year&mdash;from mobile memes to &ldquo;moblogging&rdquo; to waning interest in point-and-shoot cameras.</li>
<li>The evolution of media as content becomes digitized over various platforms: Books will take new forms, entertainment will go transmedia, and journalists will get more entrepreneurial.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some reflect counter-trends to broad shifts in consumer behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li>To balance out our increasing immersion in the digital world, people will embrace face-to-face gatherings and digital downtime, and come to fetishize physical objects once considered humdrum.</li>
<li>The trend toward Radical Transparency will see a growing backlash (Ignorance Is Bliss). </li>
</ul>
<p>As always, new technology is a theme.</p>
<ul>
<li>We&rsquo;ll see smart infrastructure ramping up, tablets for tots as this platform gets widely adopted and some truly futuristic-seeming developments (3D printing, virtual mirrors, electronic profiling).</li>
</ul>
<p>While some of our Things to Watch may not yet reflect a broader trend, we believe they eventually will ladder up to one. Retail as the Third Space, one of our Things to Watch from last year, and De-Teching, one of our Things to Watch for 2008, both gained momentum since we first spotlighted them. This year we included them among our &ldquo;10 Trends for 2011.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The people on our list&mdash;from pop culture, sports, architecture, fashion and other realms&mdash;have the potential to drive or shape trends in the near future.<br />

<h2><a name="ils_migrations">Koha and Evergreen Shine in Breeding ILS Survey Results</a></h2>
<blockquote><p>According the Breeding's data, 150 libraries migrated to Evergreen (I say migrated but his stats often reflect a "contract" not necessarily a migration) and 133 migrated to Koha. In contrast, only 53 libraries migrated to a SirsiDynix product, 48 to Agent Verso, and 28 to Millennium.</p></blockquote>

<p>Many commented on Public Domain Day -- a watershed day each year when copyrights terms are up and works enter the public domain -- but I found <a href="http://everybodyslibraries.com/2011/01/02/public-domain-day-2011-will-the-tide-be-turned/" title="Public Domain Day 2011: Will the tide be turned? | Everybody&#039;s Libraries">John Mark Ockerbloom</a> brief review of the state of copyright extensions in North America and Europe the most interesting.
