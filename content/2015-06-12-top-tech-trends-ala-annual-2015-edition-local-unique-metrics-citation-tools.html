<p>I threw my hat into the ring to be on the <a href="http://www.ala.org/lita/ttt" title="Top Tech Trends - 2015 Annual | Library Information Technology Association (LITA)"><abbr title="Library and Information Technology Association">LITA</abbr> Top Tech Trends</a> panel at the <a href="http://alaac15.ala.org/" title="2015 ALA Annual Conference"><abbr title="American Library Association">ALA</abbr> annual conference</a> later this month in San Francisco, and never could I say that I was more excited not to be selected. (You can find more info on this year's Top Tech Trends session in the <a href="http://alaac15.ala.org/node/28910" title="Top Technology Trends | 2015 ALA Annual Conference">ALA Conference Scheduler</a>.) There is a great lineup of panelists this year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sarah Houghton (Moderator), Director of the San Rafael Public Library - <a href="http://twitter.com/TheLiB" title="http://twitter.com/TheLiB">@TheLiB</a></li>
<li>Carson Block, 20-year veteran of libraries and now a library technology consultant - <a href="http://twitter.com/CarsonBlock" title="http://twitter.com/CarsonBlock">@CarsonBlock</a></li>
<li>Andrea Davis, who has her fingers in so many pies that you should really check out her <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/detailmatters" title="Andrea Davis | LinkedIn">LinkedIn profile</a> - <a href="http://twitter.com/detailmatters" title="http://twitter.com/detailmatters">@detailmatters</a></li>
<li>Grace Dunbar, Vice President of Equinox Software, Inc</li>
<li>Bonnie Tijerina, Fellow at the Data & Society Institute in New York City - <a href="http://twitter.com/bonlth" title="http://twitter.com/bonlth">@bonlth</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As part of the process, the committee asks potential panelists to explain two trends, why they are important, and how it will affect libraries.  Although I'm not on the panel this year, I thought it would be useful to post my two trends here and see what others thought.</p>
<h2>Making the local and the unique available to everyone and everywhere</h2>
<p>A core part of libraries and other cultural heritage organizations has been to collect, preserve, and make available the resources that are unique to their users, their location, and their specialization.  Up until recent years, availability of these resources spread by word-of-mouth, by citation in published literature, by large national union catalog volumes, and by short bibliographic records made available first through OCLC then by online catalogs.  With the conception and execution of projects like <a href="http://dp.la/" title="Digital Public Library of America">DPLA</a> and <a href="http://www.europeana.eu/portal/" title="Europeana - Homepage">Europeana</a>, broad audiences are finding digital surrogates (or digital copies) of these resources.  And most recently IMLS highlighted its intent to build up capabilities through its focus on a <a href="http://blog.imls.gov/?p=4886" title="IMLS Convening Focuses on the National Digital Platform | UpNext: The IMLS Blog">National Digital Platform</a> and its funding of the <a href="http://projecthydra.org/2015/04/01/imls-funds-collaborative-development-of-hydra-in-a-box/" title="IMLS funds collaborative development of &amp;#8220;Hydra-in-a-Box&amp;#8221; | Hydra Project">Hydra-in-a-Box initiative</a>.  How does that change the collection development missing?  Or the research and reference mission?  It isn't so much a matter of remaining relevant as it is to serve different audiences and different needs.  And I think public libraries are impacted the most.  How can the experiences of large -- typically academic -- libraries be applied on a large scale to cultural heritage organizations of all types?</p>
<h2>New metrics and new citation tools</h2>
<p>Last year's <a href="http://www.nmc.org/publication/nmc-horizon-report-2014-library-edition/" title="NMC Horizon Report > 2014 Library Edition | The New Media Consortium">Library Horizon Report</a> from the New Media Consortium listed "Bibliometics and Citation Technologies" with a Time-to-Adoption horizon of three years.  "Alt Metrics" has taken off to the point where NISO's Todd Carpenter suggests we should simply call them "metrics" -- there is nothing alternative about them.  If the tools of the day allow us to measure the impact of our scholars' work to the article and dataset level, how will that impact the library's mission to collect, offer, and preserve materials of local interest?  If annotation frameworks like hypothes.is take off, what is the role of libraries in preserving and contextualizing those additions to the scholarly conversation?</p>
<p>So!  If you were able to sit on the panel, what would your two top technology trends be for this year?</p>
