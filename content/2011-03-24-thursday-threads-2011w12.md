<p>This week's big news is hard to miss -- we have a <a href="#p2747-gbs">decision</a> by the judge evaluating the settlement agreement in the Google Book Search lawsuit.  This is probably the first of many follow-ups in <i><acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester">DLTJ</acronym></i> as this case keeps taking interesting twists and turns.  Also of note this week is Cornell Library's statement that it will <a href="#p2747-nda">no longer sign contracts that include non-disclosure agreements</a>.  Lastly is a pointer to a 10 minute video of <a href="#p2747-rosling">Hans Rosling's TED talk on machines leading to increased literacy</a>.</p>

## Settlement Rejected in the Google Books Search case

blockquote='In the end, I conclude that the ASA [Amended Settlement Agreement] is not fair, adequate, and reasonable. As the United States [Department of Justice] and other objectors have noted, may of the concerns raised in the objections would be ameliorated if the ASA were converted from an "opt-out" settlement to an "opt-in" settlement. I urge the parties to consider revising the ASA accordingly. The motion for final approval of the ASA is denied, without prejudice to renewal in the event the parties negotiate a revised settlement agreement. The motion for an award of attorneys&#039; fees and costs is denied, without prejudice. The Court will hold a status conference on 4/25/2011, at 4:30 p.m. in Courtroom 11A of the Daniel Patrick Moynihan Courthouse.'

Thirteen months after the last formal hearing, Judge Denny Chin issued the <a href="https://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/new-york/nysdce/1:2005cv08136/273913/971/" title="Court Opinion | The Authors guild et al v. Google Inc. | Justia Docs">opinion</a> of the New York Southern District Court: rejection of the settlement agreement between Google and a large class of authors and publishers.  The path forward is not yet clear, but there seem to be three possibilities: 1) the parties file another amended agreement that effectively ignores orphan works (copyright holds would have to opt-into the settlement); 2) the parties appeal the rejection decision; or 3) the parties move back to litigating the original 2005 case (as <a href="https://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/new-york/nysdce/1:2005cv08136/273913/59/" title="SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT amending 36 Amended Complaint, against Google Inc. | Justia Docs">amended in 2008</a>).  The first path -- filling another amended settlement agreement -- seems to be the most likely at the moment.  In their response to the court's ruling, the {% include robustlink.html href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110324000000/http://www.publishers.org/press/29/" originalurl="http://www.publishers.org/press/29/" versiondate="2011-03-24" title="Google Books Settlement Statement | Association of American Publishers" anchor="Association of American Publishers said" %}, "[the court decision] provides clear guidance to all parties as to what modifications are necessary for its approval. The publisher plaintiffs are prepared to enter into a narrower Settlement along those lines to take advantage of its groundbreaking opportunities. We hope the other parties will do so as well." {% include robustlink.html href="https://www.authorsguild.org/industry-advocacy/scott-turow-on-google-ruling/" versiondate="2011-03-24" title="Scott Turow on Google Ruling | The Authors Guild" anchor="Authors Guild President Scott Turow said" %}</a>, "we'll be studying Judge Chin's decision and plan on talking to the publishers and Google with the hope that we can arrive at a settlement within the court&rsquo;s parameters that makes sense for all parties.&rdquo;  Google was pretty non-committal:  "This is clearly disappointing, but we&rsquo;ll review the court&rsquo;s decision and consider our options."

In his analysis of the opinion, {% include robustlink.html href="http://laboratorium.net/archive/2011/03/22/inside_judge_chins_opinion" versionurl="" versiondate="2011-03-24" title="Inside Judge Chin's Opinion | The Laboratorium" anchor="New York Law School professor James Grimmelmann said" %}, "If I had to bet, I would guess that we&rsquo;ll end up with a revised settlement drafted to meet Judge Chin&rsquo;s specification, which will be approved relatively quickly (at least compared to this last go-round)."  Professor Grimmelmann goes on to predict the outlines of what a resubmitted settlement agreement might look like:

* Google is allowed to continue scanning and searching in exchange for cash payments on the order of (but perhaps not exactly) the $60 in the present settlement, and it&rsquo;s required to provide an opt-out.  Very few people have argued that this form of settlement would be beyond the court&rsquo;s power.  The precise explanation of how this would be distinguishable from the present settlement, although quite feasible, will require some nuance and subtlety.
* The Display Uses &mdash; Consumer Purchase, Institutional Subscription, etc. &mdash; are either gone entirely ore are offered on an opt-in basis.  The difference between these two possibilities is not large, since, in effect, Google already offers an opt-in through the Partner Program.
* The libraries receiving digital copies are released from liability but are even more tightly restricted in the uses they can make than under the present settlement.
* The fates of other facets of the settlement such as the Research Corpus, will be hammered out in the negotiations.
