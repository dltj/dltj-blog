  content: "Thanks for sharing your perspective Peter. \r\n\r\nThis echos one of the
    issues I have with the meetings - you seem to be talking about security, the securing
    of data. Which makes the assumption that we should be, and are collecting data.
    I am questioning if we should be collecting that data at all."

  content: Hmmm. I'm sorry that my statements are not clear.  I'm not saying one way
    or another whether the information should be collected.  I am suggesting that
    some of the processes used in information security can also be applied to patron
    privacy, especially in the area of identifying and controlling what is collected.  I
    don't think there is any way around the fact that we will need to get the personally
    identifiable information of patrons who check out items from our libraries.  What
    we do have control over is who has access to that information, how we determine
    when it is no longer needed, and what we do to dispose of it.

  content: Electronic access to information relies on at least some collection of
    data for at least some period of time to function. Don't collect it at all means
    don't provide access to electronic information. I don't think anyone advocates
    for that. Hence for me it is all about then - securing what is collected, policies
    around retention and use, and informed consent/disclosure. One open question in
    that is of course whether the LIBRARY should have access to said data or only
    the electronic information provider. I feel strongly that libraries should have
    access because we have the ethics to use it properly and also is a check on what
    is being collected by the third-party. But, one option is to say the library does
    not access or use it. But, why would we want corporate interests to have data
    and not us? (Disclosure - also on NISO group.)

  content: "That is an interesting question, Lisa.  Arguably, libraries should know
    of the patron activity data collected by third party service providers, but do
    they need to have access to that data itself?  For starters, we should only have
    access in an opt-in scenario where the patron tells the library that it is okay
    to have that activity data.\r\n\r\nBut setting that aside, libraries need assurances
    from third party providers about what they collect in the course of providing
    the service and what they do with it."

  content: "I believe that any data we are allowing third-parties should be available
    to the Library for review at a minimum. This is key to ensuring that our contracts
    are being followed - we should accept \"trust us and don't worry\"! I believe
    and am involved in a project where having user data tracked (and, we are very
    attuned to privacy concerns, have IRB, etc.) has led to service improvements that
    our users indicate they value. So, I'm interested in libraries having access to
    the data to USE it as well. If I could connect data we have from our system to
    data providers have in their systems, we could make an even better user experience.
    My service improvement question here is whether our library search system is referring
    users into databases that are ultimately found by the user to be successful. We
    have done the qualitative studies (e.g., focus groups) and user surveys. But,
    have questions we can't answer with those methods. \r\n\r\nFWIW, I think opt-in
    (or opt-out) shouldn't just be for library use but also for provider use."

  content: "I can't agree with the proposition that a library is entitled to patron
    activity data because the library pays for the subscription.  Having the library
    be the collector of all data activity data puts us at a greater risk of being
    hacked; we become a much richer target for a black hat to use to embarrass someone.
    \ (If you've heard of the term 'doxxing' before -- the act of publishing private
    information as a way of intimidating a targeted individual -- you know how harming
    that could be.  Imagine if was reading habits and research inquiries rather than
    home address or phone number.)  Knowing such information -- at least in the academic
    library space -- is also a form of competitive intelligence.  Libraries are not
    prepared to deal with the levels of information security requirements to house
    aggregate activity data like that.  \r\n\r\nIn the course of writing this comment,
    I think I'm talking myself into believing that there is a benefit to the highly
    distributed stores of patron activity data that we have now.\r\n\r\nThe question
    of whether patrons should have two opt-ins -- one to have the service provider
    store the patron activity data and yet another to allow the subscribing library
    to have access to it -- is a good one.  I fear we would quickly get to \"opt-in
    fatigue\".  I'm reminded of this every time a doctor's office asks me if I want
    a copy of the practice's HIPPA disclosure brochure.  I don't have a good answer
    for that."

    for me that no library should have access to the data on their users. I'd agree
    though that libraries should be aware of and understanding the responsibilities
    and risks they are taking on. Might also be good professional development programming
    for NISO or some other group to offer. \r\n\r\nOur IRB makes very clear who and

    need to be discussed, determined, and I'd argue disclosed to users."

  content: "I know this is getting into semantics, but I'm seeing the comments pinging
    back and forth on the concept of the \"library collecting data\" vs \"vendor collecting
    data, but library can access it.\"  I hear (paraphrased) \"we shouldn't be -entitled-
    to accessing vendor-collected data because we don't have the wherewithal to manage
    the security of it\"  \r\n\r\nAccessing vendor-collected patron data, which is
    already an out-of-context security risk for the patrons relative to the library,
    is different than the library collecting and storing a duplication of that data
    itself.  Also, as noted, 48 states and DC have laws (2 have AG opinions) regarding
    the protection of patron privacy, so libraries find themselves in a strong position
    for implementing protections of such data.  Vendors wish to protect their data
    too, but the motivations have core differences.\r\n\r\n\r\n1) Libraries collect
    data... and protect it as best they can.  Collecting new/different/additional
    data, and how to protect it, are realities libraries have to work with.  \"Don't
    do it\" really isn't a feasible or realistic option in the present or foreseeable
    future.  \r\n\r\nThe collection and maintenance of some data, for some purposes,
    for some period of time by libraries is effectively universal.  The typical default
    stance on patron data collected by libraries is assumed to be one of absolute
    minimum access and utilization.  Some of the primary questions for libraries to
    answer are related to ongoing refinement of data collection, utilization, and
    patron access policies.  \r\n\r\n2) Vendors collect data... and protect it as
    best they can (from security breaches as well as other vendors).  Data is, in
    all practicality, a new form of currency.  Proprietary use of data is highly valuable
    towards developing competitive products and services.   \r\n\r\nThe collection
    and maintenance of some data, for some purposes, for some period of time by vendors
    is effectively universal.  The assumed default stance on vendor collected data
    is \"It's ours [the vendor's] and we can do whatever we want with it.  Some of
    the primary questions for libraries to answer are related to ongoing refinement
    of policies in the areas of allowed facets of data collected, acceptable utilization,
    consumer [library] access, patron access, and distribution/sale to other parties.
    \ These questions can primarily drive pre-acquisition rules for libraries, but
    once a service is acquired, it is assumed to be much more difficult to influence
    the vendor's stance on their collected data.\r\n\r\n3) Libraries, knowing that
    patron data is being collected in some fashion, to some degree of granularity,
    with some number of facets that may potentially defeat anonymity of the patron
    as proxies behind the library, may full well desire to fight for entitlement to
    accessing vendor data in order to audit it in the raw, and possibly to access
    and audit business intelligence applied to that data by the vendor.  This access
    is, by default, separate from the library itself collecting or archiving such
    data, but the latter could be done at the library's prerogative, if SLAs/Contracts/MOUs/etc
    allow for such.  \r\n\r\nThe collection and maintenance of some already accumulated
    vendor data, for some purposes, for some period of time by libraries is subject
    to a combination of each library's prerogative and relationship/agreements with
    their respective vendors.  Some of the primary questions for libraries to answer
    are related to ongoing refinement of policies on soliciting access to third party
    collected data, accessing vendor-hosted data vs collecting and maintaining duplication
    of vendor-collected data, remaining willfully blind to vendor-collected data,
    and/or attempting to have some level of influence over the collection, usage,
    and/or other facets of vendor policies on data management."

  content: |-
    There are two separate issues here: 1) the collection, use and disposition of patron activity data by the third-party service provider; and 2) the receipt, use, and disposition of third-party service provider data by the library.

    Regarding #1: whether a library can see (or can't see) the patron activity data collected by the service provider does not tell the library how that service provider is collecting, using, or disposing of the data.  I agree that some sort of auditing framework would seem to be the most likely way to assure compliance.  What that auditing framework would look like and who pays for it is another matter entirely.  I'm sure there are probably information technology industry standards that can be brought to this issue, probably augmented with library specific needs.  This would be a good question to ask during <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/niso-patron-privacy" rel="nofollow">next Friday's fourth of four virtual meetings</a> of the <a href="http://www.niso.org/topics/tl/patron_privacy/" rel="nofollow">NISO patron privacy working group</a>.  "Trust us" isn't enough for me, either; and I think it would be a good thing to put into a <a href="/article/advancing-patron-privacy-with-shared-understanding/" rel="nofollow">shared understanding document on patron privacy practices</a>.

    Regarding #2: while as much as I love libraries, i'm not sure I trust libraries with so much information about patron's habits.  Yes, we knew who checked out books, but we didn't know who browsed them in the stacks.  Yes, we knew who requested articles by interlibrary loan, but we didn't know who photocopied journal articles in the library.  Yes, we know what online resources are used -- how many searches are down, how many articles/chapters are viewed/downloaded, and in some cases even counts on specific journal titles (according to the structure of the <a href="http://www.projectcounter.org/about.html" rel="nofollow">COUNTER reports</a>).  But I don't think libraries have any business knowing the exact activity data of our patrons across all of the services that they might use.  In limited circumstances, under IRB-like approval, in anthropological studies?  Sure.  Having that data in bulk for everyone?  I'm not convinced that is a good idea.

  content: "I'm pretty troubled by the idea that we should trust/allow third-parties
    to do bulk tracking on library users but wouldn't trust libraries to do it. That
    is a claim that goes beyond our values about what we should be doing as the framework
    to questioning our competence as organizations/professionals about whether we
    have the abilities to do it and that does not sit well with me as a carte blanche
    assessment. I'll welcome clarification if I'm misunderstanding what you wrote.
    \r\n\r\nAnd, I'd say that libraries better be good at managing and securing data
    since ... \r\n\r\nMany libraries do know who browsers their stacks/photocopies
    and possible which things they use - controlled/ID-based access, and security
    cameras seem everywhere these days, libraries included. Photocopies these days
    often included harddrives that image and save files of what is copied (and many
    users pay for copies via an ID-based card account). Printing systems are often
    login-based and have a log of what files were printed for which login (possibly
    also paid for via ID-card based account). For rare books/special collections,
    best practices are to create a permanent record of who uses what and for what
    purpose for all users. My guess is most libraries have records of books purchased
    upon recommendation. There are records of items checked out and billed for overdue
    fines/lost fees. Virtual reference and IT support systems have databases of ID'd
    queries. And, individual librarians' and staff members emails are likely filled
    with correspondence with users about their information access needs, activities,
    etc. Instruction sessions conducted in online synchronous course sessions are
    likely recorded - including any student topics used in demonstrations. And, of
    course, data on what is currently checked out is in the system. Responses to library
    assessments - user surveys, focus groups, suggestion boxes, etc. There is probably
    more I'm not thinking of. \r\n\r\nSo, while I'm not ready to assert a \"dragnet
    all the data\" approach to users use of digital resources, I don't think the case
    can be made to not do it because we are inherently not competent to do it or that
    we don't already do comprehensive tracking in other areas.  \r\n\r\nAnd, yes,
    we can look at aggregate data. But, aggregate data can only go so far in supporting
    service development, honing how we spend collections dollars, etc. As, of course,
    our colleagues in the provider/third-party world know. They wouldn't be spending
    money tracking at the level they do if it didn't create value for them."

  content: "Hey, Joshua.  So there are two pieces: a) do libraries have the law and
    legal precedence on their side to protect personally identifiable information
    (of which patron activity data is a subset)?; and b) do libraries have the technical
    wherewithal to protect such data from unintended disclosure?  On the first piece,
    I would agree that libraries -- generally -- are backed by strong laws and legal/policy
    opinions to protect patron information.  Note, though, that not all state laws
    protect all types of libraries (academic, public, school).  If we set that aside
    (and the whole issue of National Security Letter gag orders), libraries are on
    pretty strong footing here.\n\nOn the second piece, I'm not convinced.  Large
    libraries may have the funding to hire staff with an information security expertise
    (if such a need is prioritized by the library).  In the medium and small libraries
    that I've encountered, the staff tend to be generalists (and overloaded ones at
    that).  In such a case, skills in information security may be seen as an unaffordable
    luxury.  It is one thing to have systems that have the core components of data
    security built into them; it is quite another to have the skills to know how to
    use them and to audit yourself so you know where you are vulnerable, when the
    capabilities of the system(s) upon which you're relying are not enough, and what
    to do if you find something has gone wrong.  These are sweeping generalizations
    based on the small sample size of my own experience, but as someone who regularly
    volunteers a bit of time to keep the <a href=\"http://jobs.code4lib.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">jobs.code4lib.org</a>
    queue empty, I have to say that I don't see information security in many of the
    job descriptions.  \n\nFor the libraries, the collection and maintenance of personally
    identifiable information in general and patron activity data in particular is
    a universal activity.  It is also true that a default stance is to collect only
    the most minimal data and keep it only for as long as needed.  Most systems I've
    encountered follow that practice, and when they go beyond it, the system usually
    has extra levels of permissions (and sometimes auditing) in place when storage
    and access to the data goes beyond the minimum.  I think what is happening here
    is perhaps a redefinition of the phrases \"minimal data\" and \"only for as long
    as needed\" to meet new goals: personalization of system behavior and tuning retrieval
    performance based on historic activity.  If I may be so bold, what the NISO working
    group is grappling with is what it means to hold to the third principle of the
    ALA Code of Ethics in the face of these new goals: to what extent can the new
    goals be met while upholding that principle.  (For the record, I don't believe
    there is a right answer that is true for every library, but it is certainly a
    universal question that is being asked.)\n\nRegarding a position by vendors that
    patron activity data \"is ours\" (meaning the service providers'), I think there
    are a number of library staff that would take issue with that, and that too is
    another thing that the NISO working group is grappling with.  That is why I think
    a \"shared understanding\" between libraries and service providers is an appropriate
    course of action.  It is only through discussion between library staff and service
    provider staff that we can come to a common understanding followed by a registry
    of organizations that agree to that common understanding."

  content: "Let me be clear, I don't trust <em>anyone</em> -- library or service provider
    -- with bulk aggregated patron activity information.  Myself included.  (I live
    in dread of standing in front of a reporter's microphone explaining how a system
    for which I was responsible was hacked and personally identifiable information
    leaked.  This comment may come back to actually haunt me someday.)  Even with
    the best of intentions, even with millions of dollars and other resources, a database
    that aggregated the personally identifiable information and patron activity data
    of a large group of users would be too tempting of a target to not be penetrated.
    \ As an example of what a well-resourced operation faces, I think we need only
    look at what happened with the <a href=\"http://www.opm.gov/faqs/topic/cybersecurityinformation/\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">U.S. Office of Personnel Management</a> information breach this
    week to know what we are up against.  Granted, a library's patron activity data
    is not as lucrative a target as the personnel records of all federal employees,
    but what kind of resources is a library willing to put up to safeguard that data?
    \ I'll go back to the reporter's microphone question: do you have the resources
    to rest assured knowing that you won't be answering questions about a security
    breach?\n\nIn a previous comment, I made reference to a lack of libraries hiring
    staff with information security backgrounds and pointed to a lack of evidence

    is not a high priority in libraries.  Yet these are the same people that would
    be asked to secure databases with large aggregates of personal data.\n\nYou do
    list a number of cases where personal information flows through library systems.
    \ Libraries may or may not do a good job with securing them individually.  But
    what you are also proposing is that we build systems that aggregate all that information,
    and that is what becomes a bigger target for someone to attack.\n\nWhat started
    this thread of conversation was Bobbi Newman's concern that we were conflating
    security with privacy.  In some ways they are irreversibly intertwined.  While
    it is the topic of patron privacy that is bringing the working group together,
    it cannot be separated from the security concerns that underlie the patron's private
    data."

  content: "\"Do you have the resources to rest assured knowing that you won&rsquo;t
    be answering questions about a security breach?\" \r\n\r\nI don't think anyone
    has those kind of resources - that you \"won't be answering\" - nor do I think
    that should be the standard. The question is of how much security and how much
    risk the library/institution will assume. Perhaps we can assess libraries as being
    too risk-willing given the current state of hiring. I'd find it interesting if
    you found a way to do a similar analysis on the job postings from the third-party
    providers. I also think we shouldn't assume that libraries that did pursue large-scale
    data harvesting wouldn't change their hiring practices. \r\n\r\nP.S. Not sure
    what you mean by \"bulk aggregated patron data\" but it seems to me a library
    with Primo and Alma means Ex Libris has enabled exactly that for its users."

    Hmmm -- I'm struggling to know how to respond to this because we seem so far apart.  You seem to be proposing that one move forward with a project that is known at the outset to have significant risks without a demonstrated commitment to mitigate those risks.  And I don't mean your library in particular, but that of a profession.  (It is entirely possible that your library may have the commitment of resources to address the security concerns and is ready to tackle other risk and ethical considerations.)  I would propose that a lack of security focus in Code4Lib job descriptions is a significant barrier to the profession considering widespread adoption of a system that would collect and store patron activity data.

    You ask a great question about job postings from service providers.  In the postings that I've seen on <a href="http://jobs.code4lib.org/" rel="nofollow">http://jobs.code4lib.org/</a>, less than one in 20 is from a service provider.  For whatever reason, service providers are not posting tech job descriptions to the sources that are aggregated at jobs.code4lib.org.  That is either a statement about the hiring practices of service providers or a lack of coverage in the jobs.code4lib.org aggregator.  I asked Ed Summers, the keeper of the jobs.code4lib.org site, how many job announcement have been posted there; his reply, as of this afternoon: 4,597.  (That's out of 21,445 submitted.  The difference is job descriptions that are duplicate -- same job from more than one source -- or are considered out-of-scope for a code4lib.org audience. Thanks, Ed!)

    Oh, and "bulk aggregated patron data" is a shortcut I'm using to mean the transfer of all patron activity data from a service provider to a library.  (Or vice-versa for that matter, I imagine.)  Put another way, it is a service provider capturing all patron activity (without regard for opt-in/opt-out request) to the library in an unanonymized form.

  content: Actually, I'm only proposing that we not say "no library should ever do
    this because the risk is too high" ... I'm not saying "every library should do
    this." In fact, I think there are many who would self-assess as not able to carry
    it out appropriately. So, we may be less far apart than it appeared.

  content: "My point, which seems to align with Lisa's was/is this:  You shouldn't
    be too worried about whether or not all libraries, or even most libraries, or
    even just some libraries have the wherewithal to protect data (PII, PAD, or other).
    \ We have some, it needs to be protected, we'll do the best we can.  Whether or
    not we have access to more, want access to more, or want nothing to do with more
    than the bare minimum required to operate successfully isn't really something
    that should be (in my opinion) the primary consideration of any PII/PAD/Security
    framework.  The spectrum of data collection desirability by libraries across the
    country should (again, IMO) be assumed, and a PII/PAD/Security framework should
    be established which supports the spectrum.\r\n\r\nAnd regarding vendors that
    already have data... good luck convincing them it's not \"theirs.\"  Any PII/PAD/Security
    framework should help libraries with developing SLA/MOU/SoW/etc language which
    mitigates that \"ownership\" as much as possible BEFORE collection...."

Both of us are on the <a href="http://www.niso.org/topics/tl/patron_privacy/" title="Patron Privacy in Digital Library and Information Systems - National Information Standards Organization">NISO committee to develop a Consensus Framework to Support Patron Privacy in Digital Library and Information Systems</a>, and her article sounded a note of discouragement that I hope to dispel while also outlining what I'm hoping to see come out of the process.  I think we share a common belief: the privacy of our patron's activity data is paramount to the essence of being a library.  I want to pull out a couple of sentences from her post:</p>
<blockquote><p>Libraries negotiate with vendors on behalf of their patrons. Library users trust the library, and the choses librarians make need to be worthy of that trust. </p></blockquote>
<p>Wholeheartedly agree!</p>
<blockquote><p>Librarians should be able to tell users exactly what information vendors are collecting about them and what they are doing with that data.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is why I am engaged in the NISO effort.  As librarians, I don't think we do have a good handle on the patron activity data that we are collecting and the intersection of our service offerings with what third parties might do with it.  Eric Hellman lays out a somewhat dark scenario in his <a href="http://go-to-hellman.blogspot.com/2015/06/towards-post-privacy-library.html" title="Go To Hellman: Towards the Post-Privacy Library?">Towards the Post-Privacy Library?</a> article published in the recent <a href="http://www.ala.org/news/press-releases/2015/05/new-american-libraries-supplement-finds-libraries-offense-digital-revolution" title="New American Libraries supplement finds libraries on the offense in the digital revolution | News and Press Center"><i>American Libraries Digital Futures</i> supplement</a>.  ((While I have a stage, can I point out<br />
https://twitter.com/DataG/status/603897280496820224<br />
))  What I'm hoping comes out of this is a framework for awareness and a series of practices that libraries can take to improve patron privacy.</p>
<ol>
<li>A statement of principles of what privacy means for library patrons in the highly digital distributed environment that we are in now.</li>
<li>A recognition that protecting privacy is an incremental process, so we need something like the "SANS Critical Security Controls" (https://www.sans.org/critical-security-controls) to help libraries take an inventory of their risks and to seek resources to address them.</li>
<li>A "Shared Understanding" between service subscribers and service providers around expectations for privacy.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="statement-of-principles">A statement of principles...</h2>
<p>We have lived through a radical shift in how information and services are delivered to patrons, and I'd argue we haven't thought through the impacts of that shift.  There was a time when libraries collected information <em>just in case</em> for the needs of their patrons:  books, journals/periodicals, newspapers and the catalogs and indexes that covered them.  Not so long ago -- at least in my professional lifetime -- we were making the transition from paper indexes to CD-ROM indexes.  We saw the beginnings of online delivery in services like Dialog and FirstSearch, but for the most part everything was under our roof.</p>
<p>Nowadays, however, we purchase or subscribe to services where information is delivered <em>just in time</em>.  Gone are the days of shelf-after-shelf of indexes and the tedium of swapping CD-ROMs in large towers.  "The resource is online, and it is constantly updated!" we trumpeted. And in recent years even the library's venerable online catalog is often hosted by service providers.  It makes for more efficient information delivery, but it also brings more actors into the interaction between our patrons and our information providers.  It is that reality we need to account for, and to educate each other on the privacy implications of those new actors.</p>
<h2 id="critical-privacy-controls">A recognition that protecting privacy is an incremental practice...</h2>
<p>One of the important lessons from the information security field is that protecting software systems is never "done" -- it is never a checklist or a completed audit or a one-time task.  Security professionals developed the "<a href="https://www.sans.org/critical-security-controls">Critical Security Controls</a>" list to get a handle on persistent and new forms of attack.  From the introduction:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the years, many security standards and requirements frameworks have been developed in attempts to address risks to enterprise systems and the critical data in them. However, most of these efforts have essentially become exercises in reporting on compliance and have actually diverted security program resources from the constantly evolving attacks that must be addressed. ... The Critical Security Controls focuses first on prioritizing security functions that are effective against the latest Advanced Targeted Threats, with a strong emphasis on "What Works" - security controls where products, processes, architectures and services are in use that have demonstrated real world effectiveness.</p></blockquote>
<p>The current edition has 20 items, and they are listed in a priority order.  If an organization does nothing more than the first five, then it has already done a lot to protected itself from the most common threats.</p>
<p>Patron privacy needs to be addressed in the same way.  There are things we can do that will have the most impact for the effort, and once we get a handle on those then we can move on to other less impactful areas.  And just as the SANS organization regularly convenes professionals to review and make recommendations based on new threats and practices, so too must our "critical privacy controls" be updates as new service models are introduced and new points of privacy threats are found.</p>
<h2 id="shared-understanding">A shared understanding...</h2>
<p>Libraries will not be able to raise the privacy levels of their patrons activities without involving the service providers that we new rely on.  At the second open teleconference of the NISO patron privacy effort, I briefly presented my thoughts on <a href="/article/advancing-patron-privacy-with-shared-understanding/">why a shared understanding between libraries and service providers was important</a>.  I found it interesting that during the same teleconference we identified a need from service providers need a "service level agreement" of sorts that covers how the libraries must react to detected breaches in proxy systems ((A proxy server, while enabling a patron to get access to third-party information services while not on the library's network, also acts as an anonymizing agent of sorts.  The service provider only sees the aggregate activity of all patrons coming through the proxy server.  That makes it impossible, though, for a service provider to fight off a bulk-download attack without help from the library.)).  With NISO acting as an ideal intermediary, the parties can come together and create a shared understanding of what each other need in this highly distributed world.</p>
<h2>Making Progress</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/TLDR">TL;DR</a>-at-the-bottom summary?  Take heart, Bobbi.  I think we are seeing the part of the process where a bunch of ideas are thrown out (including mine above!) and we begin the steps to condense all of those ideas into a plan of action.  I, for one, am not interested in improving services at the expense of our core librarian ethic to hold in confidence the activities of our patrons.  I don't see it as a matter of matching the competition; in fact, I see this activity as a distinguishing characteristic for libraries.  This week <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/06/the-online-privacy-lie-is-unraveling/" title="The Online Privacy Lie Is Unraveling | TechCrunch">the news outlet TechCrunch reported</a> on a <a href="https://www.asc.upenn.edu/news-events/publications/tradeoff-fallacy-how-marketers-are-misrepresenting-american-consumers-and" title="The Tradeoff Fallacy: How Marketers Are Misrepresenting American Consumers and Opening Them Up to Exploitation | Annenberg School for Communication">study by the Annenberg School for Communication</a> on how "a majority of Americans are resigned to giving up their data" when they "[believe] an undesirable outcome is inevitable and [feel] powerless to stop it."  If libraries can honestly say -- because we've studied the issue and proactively protected patrons -- that we are a reliable source of exceptional information provided in a way that is respectful of the patron's desire to control how their activity information is used, then I think we have a good story to tell and a compelling service to offer.</p>
