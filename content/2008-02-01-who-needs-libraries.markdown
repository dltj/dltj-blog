<p>OhioLINK's Meg Spernoga pointed our staff to a 30 minute audio documentary called <a href="http://www.soundprint.org/radio/display_show/ID/629/name/Who+needs+libraries" title="Who needs libraries?">Who Needs Libraries?</a> from Soundprint.org:</p>
<blockquote><p>
As more and more information is available on-line, as Amazon rolls out new software that allows anyone to find any passage in any book, an important question becomes: Who needs libraries anymore? Why does anyone need four walls filled with paper between covers? Surprisingly, they still do and in this program Producer Richard Paul explores why; looking at how university libraries, school libraries and public libraries have adapted to the new information world. This program airs as part of our ongoing series on education and technology, and is funded in part by the U.S. Department of Education.</p>
<p>Produced by Richard Paul. Hosted by Lisa Simeone.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Some of the topics covered:</p>
<ul type="square">
<li>Numbers of New/Renovated public libraries are steady</li>
<li>Use of consortial depositories by academic libraries</li>
<li>Licensed content that can't be found in Google (pros -- immediate access; and cons -- preservation)</li>
<li>Widespread digitization of content for online access (pros and cons)</li>
<li>Impact of Gates Foundation money on public library services</li>
<li>Changing ways libraries are being used</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks, Meg!</p>
