  content: I agree with post format leads, good roundup of developments in google
    anti trust book settlement. Greed has surfaced as the primary factor in the abolishment
    of intellectual property rights as copyright law.

<p>Today was to be the deadline for objecting to, opting out of, and/or filing briefs with the court on the <a href="http://books.google.com/googlebooks/agreement/" title="Google Book Search Settlement Agreement">Google Book Search Settlement</a>.  That was the plan, at least, when the <a href="http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/new-york/nysdce/1:2005cv08136/273913/64/" title="Court order granting preliminary settlement approval, 17-Nov-2008">preliminary approval statement</a> from the court was issued last year.  That deadline changed, and that is part of a recent flurry of activity surrounding the proposed Settlement.  This post provides a summary of recent news and an index of documents that you might want to read for more information.<br />
<!--more--></p>
<h2>First, Recent News</h2>
<ul type="disc">
<li>The Internet Archive, a <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07175/796164-96.stm" title="The Internet gives birth to an 'official' online library">recognized library in the State of California</a>, filed a request to intervene as a defendant party to the lawsuit in order to represent the interests of libraries.  (<a href="http://www.opencontentalliance.org/2009/04/17/internet-archive-files-intervention-request/" title="Internet Archive files Intervention Request on Open Content Alliance (OCA) blog">Open Content Alliance blog</a>, 17-Apr-2009)  The request was subsequently denied.  (<a href="http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/new-york/nysdce/1:2005cv08136/273913/92/" title="The Author's Guild et al v. Google Inc. Document 92 - :: Justia Docs">Court order by Denny Chin</a>, 24-Apr-2009)
	</li>
<li>The judge overseeing the Settlement <a href="http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/new-york/nysdce/1:2005cv08136/273913/89/" title="The Author's Guild et al v. Google Inc. Document 89 - :: Justia Docs">agreed</a> to a request by a coalition of copyright holders -- members of the proposed plaintiff class -- to postpone the date by which rights holders needed to opt-out of the settlement class or file objections to the settlement itself to September 4th. (<a href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/04/google-agrees-to-books-settlement-delay/" title="Google Agrees to Books Settlement Delay | Epicenter blog at Wired Magazine">Wired Magazine</a>, 27-Apr-2009; <a href="http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/new-york/nysdce/1:2005cv08136/273913/89/" title="The Author's Guild et al v. Google Inc. Document 89 - :: Justia Docs">Court order by Denny Chin</a>)</li>
<li>The Justice Department reportedly initiated an inquiry into antitrust implications of the Settlement agreement.  This doesn't mean that the department will oppose the settlement, but it suggests that the department finds some of the arguments being made at least worthy of further inquiry.  (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/29/technology/internet/29google.html" title="Justice Dept. Opens Antitrust Inquiry Into Google Books Deal, NY Times">New York Times</a>, 28-Apr-2009)</li>
<li>Google began to respond to some of the criticism directed on its Public Policy Blog ("Google's views on government, policy and politics").  In this initial post, one of a promised many, the director of product management for Google Book Search describes how the settlement agreement represents expanded access over what the Book Search service currently offers. (<a href="http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2009/04/google-book-search-settlement-will.html" title="Google Public Policy Blog: Google Book Search settlement will expand access">Google Public Policy Blog</a>, 29-Apr-2009)</li>
<li><acronym title="American Library Association">ALA</acronym>, <acronym title="Association of College and Research Libraries">ACRL</acronym>, and <acronym title="Association of Research Libraries">ARL</acronym> filed a <a href="http://wo.ala.org/gbs/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/googlebrieffinal.pdf" title="ALA, ACRL, ARL joint amicus brief in response to the Google Book Search Settlement">brief</a> [22-page PDF] with the court requesting that it provide for strict supervision over the implementation of the agreement, should the court approve it. (<a href="/article/gbs-libraries-brief/"><acronym title="Library Associations File Amicus Brief for Google Book Search Settlement, DLTJ"><i>DLTJ</i></acronym> summary of brief</a>, 4-May-2009; <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/04/libraries-ask-judge-to-monitor-google-books-settlement/" title="Libraries Ask Judge to Monitor Google Books Settlement - Bits Blog - NYTimes.com">NY Times Bits Blog</a>, 4-May-2009)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Then, More In-depth Information</h2>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Pamela Samuelson for O'Reilly Radar: <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/04/legally-speaking-the-dead-soul.html" title="Pamela Samuelson on O'Reilly Radar blog">Legally Speaking:  The Dead Souls of the Google Booksearch Settlement</a> -- A little over four printed pages giving a very brief overview of the Settlement, describing the class action nature of the lawsuit, the potential for a Google monopoly of the largest digital library of books, and the sticky problem of orphan works. (17-Apr-2009, also scheduled to appear in the July 2009 issue of <i>Communications of the ACM</i>)</li>
<li>ALA/ARL Settlement Summary: <a href="http://wo.ala.org/gbs/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/a-guide-for-the-perplexed.pdf" title="ALA/ARL Summary of Settlement Terms">A Guide for the Perplexed: Libraries &amp; the Google Library Project Settlement</a> [PDF]: Twenty-three double-spaced pages that is an early description of the terms of the settlement agreement with a focus on what the settlement, as currently written, could mean for libraries. (13-Nov-2008)</li>
<li>James Grimmelmann for the American Constitution Society for Law and Policy: <a href="http://www.acslaw.org/files/Grimmelmann%20Issue%20Brief.pdf" title="Grimmelmann's Google Book Search Settlement report">The Google Book Search Settlement: Ends, Means, and the Future of Books</a> -- Seventeen pages of dense prose in three parts:  an analysis of the lawsuit and its settlement, an in-depth examination of the problem of orphan works, and a proposal for handling the resolution of orphan works through a legislative process rather than a judicial process.  (April 2009)</li>
<li>Walt Crawford's Cites &amp; Insights: "<a href="http://citesandinsights.info/civ9i4.pdf" title="Cites and Insights, Volume 9, Issue 4 in PDF">Perspective: The Google Book Search Settlement</a>" -- Walt devotes an entire 30-page issue to summation of the issues and pointers to dozens (if not 100) other postings and reports on the Settlement.  <em>Highly recommended</em> if you want to dive in and learn all you can about the nature of the settlement and the resulting commentary. (March 2009)</li>
