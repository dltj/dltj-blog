    did the jpeg2000 (.jp2) support ever make it into firefox? this
    would be very very useful for the Internet Archive's book scanning
    project. -brewster

<p>OhioLINK is not participating in the <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/" title="Google Summer of Code">Google Summer of Code</a> this year (too many other things going on for our staff to be effective mentors), which is why it is refreshing to see work on the wider adoption of JPEG2000 &mdash; one of our core goals &mdash; continue on other fronts.  Among this year's <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.third-bit.com/soc2007.html">900 projects accepted by mentors</span> are two that involve J2K.  All of this is welcome news, coming in the same month that <a href="/article/j2k-in-photoshop/">Adobe is questioning the need for JPEG2000 support in Photoshop</a>.  My public gratitude goes out to Google for their third year of offering financial and logistical support to their Summer of Code program.</p>
<h2>JPEG2000 in Firefox</h2>
<p>Ben Karel, a Computer Science undergraduate student at the University of Delaware, will be working on <span class="removed_link" title="http://code.google.com/soc/mozilla/appinfo.html?csaid=C7B9CCBBF96648B3">JPEG2000 Support for Firefox</span>.   His <a href="http://eschew.org/projects/soc/2007/application.html" title="JPEG2000 Proposal">proposal page</a> has details about how he seeks to accomplish this, either as a part of the Mozilla code base or as a third-party extension.  His mentor is <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.pavlov.net/blog/">Stuart Parmenter</span>, owner of Mozilla "ImageLib" module and co-owner of the Mozilla "gfx" module.</p>
<h2>JPEG2000 in FFMPEG</h2>
<p>Kamil Nowosad of Warsaw University in Poland will be working on <span class="removed_link" title="http://code.google.com/soc/ffmpeg/appinfo.html?csaid=1CBF43B104682F6">a JPEG2000 decoder and encoder for FFMPEG</span>.  Mentored by Loren Merritt, there doesn't seem to be much information about this project that is publicly available, so I'm looking forward to hearing more about it.  (For one, since it is working on the <a href="http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/" title="FFmpeg homepage">FFmpeg media system</a> I presume the work is on <em>Motion</em> JPEG2000.)
