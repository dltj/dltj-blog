- Happy Thursday everyone! This week's issue of the DLTJ Thursday Threads #newsletter offers some updates on previous conversation threads. https://dltj.org/article/issue-95-chatgpt-cryptomining-wssl 1/5
- First off, on Saturday @bibliotecaria@blacktwitter.io recounted a tale of a patron looking for an book that #ChatGPT recommended. It turns out that ChatGPT generated a reference for a book that doesn't exist. #InformationLiteracy, anyone? https://dltj.org/article/issue-95-chatgpt-cryptomining-wssl#chatgpt-bad-reference 2/5
- Second, news breaks yesterday that news is being generated by a #NaturalLanguageProcessing model overseen by human editors. Is this a good idea? https://dltj.org/article/issue-95-chatgpt-cryptomining-wssl#ai-news-generator 3/5
- Third, it was a year ago that #CryptocurrencyMiners announced that they were leaving China and Kosovo for Texas. Now they have to cut back on their energy usage so the rest of the state can heat its homes. https://dltj.org/article/issue-95-chatgpt-cryptomining-wssl#cryptocurrency-energy 4/5
- Last, we look back 12 years to a project that could have cheaply and efficiently made a website for every library. But the #OCLC #WorldShare for Small #Libraries never took off. https://dltj.org/article/issue-95-chatgpt-cryptomining-wssl#wssl 5/5

One of the Thursday Threads issues last month focused on [Chat-bots Powered by Artificial Intelligence](https://dltj.org/article/issue-93-ai-chat/). 
This weekend I saw this fediverse post from Wanda Whitney; a patron was looking for a book recommended by ChatGPT. 
This is a problem known as "stochastic parroting". 
Let's ask ChatGPT to define that term...

This can happen when the model is simply repeating patterns it has learned from the training data, rather than using its understanding of the meaning of the input to generate a response.
>
> This is a problem for large language models like GPT-3 because the amount of data these models are trained on is so huge that they are able to memorize large amount of text and sometimes can repeat it back which might not be relevant to the task or context, this can be mitigated by fine-tuning the model with smaller dataset that is domain specific, or other techniques like controlling sampling temperature and restricting the model's training to a certain task.

From what I've read, that is a pretty good answer. 
The algorithm behind the large language model uses statistical probabilities to find the most likely next word based on the previous words. 
Even if that generates nonsense in the real world. 
I still think that the invention and wide-scale use of large-scale natural language models like ChatGPT means an increased importance on information literacy training.
Let's get to it, librarians!

Also in that Thursday Threads issue was mention of how AI can [change the nature of essay-writing](https://dltj.org/article/issue-93-ai-chat#ai-essays) and instructors can adapt to the change by making the assignment about editing rather than writing text. 
Publishers are trying out just that thing.

## Cryptocurrency miners in Texas forced to shut down due to electricity shortage

blockquote='As Texas and much of the U.S. confronts the challenges of this winter storm, the bitcoin mining industry in Texas is playing a part in supporting the Texas grid during this challenging time by proactively curtailing power.

A _Thursday Thread_ from a year ago was [cryptocurrencyâ€™s energy consumption](https://dltj.org/article/issue-80-cryptocurrency-mining-interlibrary-loan/#cryptocurrency-energy) and how cryptocurrency miners were heading for Texas after being forced out of China and Kosovo. 
Now comes last month's press release from the Texas Blockchain Council on how they shed load as the grid struggled to keep up with heating demands. 
Still no word on why using energy for fraud-supporting busy-work calculations is a better use of excess capacity than, say, some form of _energy storage_ that would help smooth out the bumps in the grid.

Unfortunately, the project didn't last, and I wish I knew more about why it didn't take off.
I couldn't find the Loremville Public Library sample site on Wayback, so the only thing that may be left is this low resolution screenshot I made for [my 2010 article](https://dltj.org/article/a-web-presence-for-small-libraries/).


## Extra Cat!

We had a visiting cat for Christmas break! 
This sweetheart is _Pickle_, which is short for _Dill Pickle Murray_, and is my daughter's college apartment cat. 
It took most of the Christmas break for Pickle to get comfortable in the house and for Mittens and Alan to get comfortable with Pickle. 
Okay, honestly, neither of them liked Pickle as a new interloper in the house. 
To be honest, Mittens and Alan are much better behaved with each other since Pickle left. 
Maybe the two of them realized how good a two-cats-only household is?
