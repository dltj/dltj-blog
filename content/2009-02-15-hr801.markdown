  content: "Dear Jester,   I have sent a letter to several Michigan journalists asking
    them to explain why HR801 is such a very bad idea--especially here in Michigan
    since the governor has emphasized the importance of developing life science businesses
    as one way to counter the dismal auto industry problems. One  journalist has responded
    with the following:\r\n\r\n\"Help us speed up the research a bit: What is your
    understanding of the other side of the issue?  That is, why would Conyers want
    to do this? \"\r\n\r\nI should  note that in my email to the journalists I specifically
    wrote:\r\n\r\n There is nothing fair or reasonable about this act and I cannot
    think of one good reason for why he [[Conyers] sponsored this bill.\r\n\r\nPlease
    help.  How would you and/or your readers respond to this question?  I have sent
    a fax asking Rep Conyers why he sponsored this bill but have not received a reply.\r\n\r\nLorraine"

  content: "Lorraine --\r\n\r\nThe answer probably goes back a number of years.  H.R.801
    in this congressional session isn't the first time this language has been proposed.
    \ The wording is nearly identical to <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-h6845/show\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">H.R.6845 from the previous congressional session</a>.  Rep. Conyers
    submitted a statement for this previous version to the Congressional Record (the
    daily compilation of the activities of congress) on <a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/R?r110:FLD001:E51753\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">September 10, 2008</a> (select the second entry -- \"Introduction
    of the Fair Copyright in Research Works Act of 2008\").\r\n\r\nIn a <a href=\"http://www.aip.org/fyi/2008/091.html\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">summary by the the American Institute of Physics</a> (a supporter
    of this legislation) of a hearing for H.R.6845 before the Subcommittee on Courts,
    the Internet, and Intellectual Property, there is this: <blockquote>Conyers, the
    author of the bill [H.R.6845] and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, had
    no doubts. He spoke of the \"very questionable premises\" surrounding the establishment
    of the NIH policy, and criticized the House Appropriations Committee for its action
    [in drafting the NIH policy enabling legislation] and its \"zero\" communication
    with his committee.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nMaybe it is a turf battle between congressional
    committees.  Maybe it goes deeper.  According to MAPLight.org, this bill (both
    in the previous session and in the current session) is supported by the \"Book,
    newspaper & periodical publishing\" industry, and <span class=\"removed_link\"
    title=\"http://maplight.org/map/us/bill/77926/default/committees/393\">that industry
    has given $20,218 to Rep. Conyers from 2003 to 2008</span>.  That is more than
    most of the other committee members.  Representative Wexler, a co-sponsor of the
    legislation, received $21,300.\r\n\r\nPlease do let us know if you hear back from
    Rep. Conyers!"

This would not only reverse the <a href="http://publicaccess.nih.gov/" title="NIH Public Access Policy">NIH Public Access Policy</a> but would also stop other federal agencies from following a similar course.  This is, in my humble opinion, bad.  I continue to think that open access to federally-funded research is an appropriate expectation based on the use of taxpayer money &mdash; both individual and corporate money &mdash; to fund such research.  To the extent that the proposed legislation would prevent this from happening, I oppose it.</p>
<p>The NIH Public Access Policy seems well reasoned.  It requires that the "final, peer-reviewed manuscript" &mdash; <a href="http://publicaccess.nih.gov/FAQ.htm#c5" title="FAQ answer to question &#039;What is the difference between a final peer-reviewed manuscript and final published article?&#039;">a phrase defined in the policy FAQ</a> &mdash; be deposited into <a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/" title="PubMed Central Homepage">PubMed Central</a>.  To the extent that the value-added "final published article" &mdash; <a href="http://publicaccess.nih.gov/FAQ.htm#c5" title="FAQ answer to question &#039;What is the difference between a final peer-reviewed manuscript and final published article?&#039;">another phrase defined by the policy FAQ</a> &mdash; contains creative work by the publisher, that version is covered by copyright under whatever author agreement was signed.  The FAQ <a href="http://publicaccess.nih.gov/FAQ.htm#d6" title="FAQ answer to question &#039;Why does NIH require me to submit the final, peer-reviewed manuscript?&#039;">specifically states</a> that NIH wants the final, peer-reviewed manuscript &mdash; the version of the paper before the creative efforts by the publisher are applied.</p>

<p>On February 3rd, Representative John Conyers (D-MI) introduced a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:h.r.00801:" title="H.R.801 in LC&#039;s THOMAS">H.R.801</a> with the short title of "Fair Copyright in Research Works Act".  As common in the legislative process, the bill was referred to a committee &mdash; the <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/" title="The United States House of Representatives Committee On The Judiciary">House Judiciary Committee</a>, in this case, where <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090215083804/http://judiciary.house.gov:80/about/bio.html" title="Chairman&#039;s Bio">Rep. Conyers is the chair</a>.  The introduced legislation seeks to amend <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/201" title="US CODE: Title 17,201. Ownership of copyright">Section 201 of title 17 of the United States Code</a> ("Ownership of copyright") by adding this new section:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol type="a" start="6">

<li>requires the absence or abandonment of any right described in subclause (I) or (II) of clause (i) in an extrinsic work;</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>impose or cause the imposition of, as a condition of a funding agreement, the waiver of, or assent to, any prohibition under subparagraph (A); or</li>
<li>assert any rights under this title in material developed under any funding agreement that restrain or limit the acquisition or exercise of rights under this title in an extrinsic work.</li>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm neither a lawyer nor a legislator, but to me that seems like an incredibly twisted and convoluted text.  That makes me immediately wary of it.  The crux of the issue would seem to be that the proposed legislation means that a federal agency can no longer compel an author to accept any terms for publication of papers -- including open access terms.  That would overrule the NIH Public Access mandate.  The <a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20090212210053/http://www.taxpayeraccess.org//action//HR801-09-0211.html" title="ATA : OPPOSE H.R.801">analysis published by the Alliance for Taxpayer Access</a> goes into other details.</p>
<h2>Jester's Response</h2>
<p>I've sent this letter to my representative:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Honorable Patrick J. Tiberi<br />
3000 Corporate Exchange Dr.<br />
Suite 310<br />
Columbus, Ohio 43231</p>
<p>Subject: Opposition to H.R.801, the Fair Copyright in Research Works Act</p>
<p>Dear Representative Tiberi:</p>
<p>As a constituent in Ohio's 12th district, I urge you to oppose H.R.801, the Fair Copyright in Research Works Act, as introduced to the House Judiciary Committee on February 3, 2009.  This bill would amend the U.S. Copyright Code, prohibiting federal agencies from requiring as a condition of funding agreements public access to the products of the research they fund.  More specifically, it would overturn the Open Access Policy of research funded by the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>Open, public access to federally-funded research is an appropriate expectation for the use of taxpayer money &mdash; both individual and corporate money &mdash; to fund such research.  To the extent that the proposed legislation would prevent this from happening, I urge you to oppose it.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>/Peter E. Murray/</p></blockquote>
