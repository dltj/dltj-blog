<p>The <a href="http://www.uso.edu/" title="University System of Ohio homepage">University System of Ohio</a> invites you to <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.oln.org/conferences/LLT2009/LLT2009proposal.php">submit proposals</span> for the <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.oln.org/conferences/LLT2009/LLT2009.php">Learning, Libraries and Technology Conference</span>, March 1-3, 2009. The conference features both submitted and invited presentations, technology demonstrations, pre-conference workshops and plenary presentations.  Proposals for presentations in a number of content areas are sought and described below. In addition to the specific topics listed under each broad category, we strongly encourage proposals that represent effective use of educational technology, teaching and learning paradigms, efficient organization and dissemination of information, and innovations in education. This year, we are especially encouraging topics that deal with the intersection and interaction of higher education and the K-12 education community.  Deadline to submit a proposal is <strong>October 15, 2008</strong>.</p>
<div style="border:2px solid #333; background-color: #CCC; color:black; margin: 2em; padding: 1em;"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/note.png" alt="Note!" border="0" style="float:left; margin-bottom: 10em; overflow: hidden; padding-right: 1em; text-align: justify;" />Presenters in all conference venues are expected to provide dynamic and provocative learning opportunities for attendees, be cognizant of adult learning preferences, address ADA and Section 508 Accessibility standards, and effectively model the utilization of learning technologies.  Far too often, conference sessions involve the overuse of presentation software.  Conference sessions should be interactive and engage the participants.  The presentation selection criteria strongly favor presentations that demonstrably engage participants.</div>
<h2>Conference Sessions</h2>
<p>Abstracts for conference sessions are sought for the following themes. Each submission will be peer reviewed. Presentations selected will best serve the themes of the conference and the needs of the learners.</p>
<h3>Teaching and Learning in the 21st Century</h3>
<p>This theme addresses the core mission of our educational system and should provide conference participants with exemplary models and discussions regarding excellence in education. Topics included (but not limited to) are: pedagogy (particularly as it relates to instructional technology), achievable learning objectives, assessment and evaluation, and skills development for the 21st century educator. Presentations targeted to both experienced and new educators are welcome.</p>
<p>Your proposal might answer these questions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Can service learning improve engagement and enable students to meet academic learning objectives?</li>
<li>Has the shift to instructional technology resulted in better teaching?</li>
<li>What do faculty new to instructional technology need to know to use it effectively?</li>
<li>How can faculty use virtual environments to provide authentic learning experiences?</li>
<li>How can organizations efficiently manage availability and access to relevant digital content?</li>
<li>How best can we assess student learning outcomes with ePortfolios?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Student Success</h3>
<p>The primary mission of the State&rsquo;s educational institutions is to serve our students. This theme addresses how we are doing in our mission to serve students well. Topics will include (but are not limited to): mentoring and tutoring, first year experiences, student learning communities, documenting knowledge, and providing opportunities to under-served populations.</p>
<p>Please answer:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Do we know what it takes to improve retention in academic programs?</li>
<li>How do you effectively manage a peer tutoring / teaching program?</li>
<li>Are student learning communities successful? If so, where&rsquo;s the evidence?</li>
<li>Have student success plans made a difference to student achievement? &nbsp;</li>
<li>What does it take to develop a relevant, cost-effective first year experience?</li>
<li>Are students prepared to be successful in the types of careers that the state needs?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ohio Is Moving Forward</h3>
<p>Ohio&rsquo;s economy needs more residents ready to contribute at a high level.&nbsp; To achieve this, the state needs to dramatically increase the number of students who attend, succeed, and graduate with a degree that counts. This will require levels of political, business and educational collaboration that are difficult to create and sustain. On campus, changes in information technology, resources and student demographics are creating significant changes in how educational opportunities are developed and delivered. This theme addresses programs and collaborations designed to serve the state well. Topics will include (but are not limited to): effective business / academic partnerships that serve more Ohioans, collaborations between K-12 and higher education that serve demonstrated state needs, strengthening ties between Ohio&rsquo;s colleges and universities, programs that remove barriers for adult learners, and addressing educational needs of the Ohio workforce.<br />
Example questions that presentations around this theme might address include:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>How is the University System of Ohio helping more Ohioans?</li>
<li>What does it take for us to share content, students, faculty, technology, and practices across institutions and across primary and secondary education?</li>
<li>How can we provide relevant access to programs regardless of location or income?</li>
<li>How will tuition restraint impact the state known as &ldquo;one of the most expensive places&rdquo; to earn a college education?</li>
<li>How do we pave the avenues for recent high school graduates or adult learners into the higher education system?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Transforming Technologies</h3>
<p>Whether purposefully integrated by an IT department or found in the pockets of our students, technology is transforming education and the way we interact with each other. The advances and pervasiveness of technology will continue to bring changes to our educational systems and we must develop appropriate and relevant means to evaluate and, when appropriate, adopt new technologies. Topics in this theme will include (but are not limited to): emerging technologies, virtual environments for learning, gaming / visualization, and security.</p>
<p>Example questions that presentations around this theme might address include:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Are social networking sites appropriate for conducting campus business?</li>
<li>Will real time video replace the traditional lecture?</li>
<li>Can gaming improve learning in measurable ways?</li>
<li>Do virtual environments and social networking provide learning experiences unavailable in the classroom?</li>
<li>What does it take for campus IT to keep up in order to provide both opportunities for learning and information security?</li>
</ul>
<h3>P-20 Education</h3>
<p>Some of the boundaries between higher education and P-12 are constructive and appropriate; many are a result of out-dated systems and turf battles. Moreover, we all have an interest and a responsibility to ensure citizens contribute to a viable economy and an integrated educational system achieves this more efficiently than a segmented one.&nbsp; This track is a preview of the 2010 annual conference which will be redesigned to encompass a broad P-20 education system. Topics this year will include (but are not limited to): dual enrollment programs, collaborative programs that seek educational gains, technologies for all classrooms, in-service experiences for teachers, and policy changes that encourage broad collaboration.</p>
<p>Example questions that presentations around this theme might address include:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Can the &ldquo;seniors to sophomores&rdquo; initiative succeed with the current education funding structure?</li>
<li>Will grades 11-12 and freshman year be the real place to transform education?</li>
<li>Do NSF sponsored RET programs result in meaningful changes in how teachers teach and in students&rsquo; interests?</li>
<li>When is an AP course an appropriate substitute for a college course?</li>
<li>How do you make room in a standards-based curriculum for inquiry-based learning?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Non-traditional Presentations: A Challenge and an Opportunity</h3>
<p>Our previous conferences featured a non-traditional presentations that were &ldquo;outside the box&rdquo; with the intent to more completely engage and involve participants. This year, we will continue this approach by incorporating non-traditional formats within each presentation theme. &nbsp;While a lecture style presentation can be informative and appropriate for some topics, it is our hope that many of the presentations within the tracks will adopt innovative approaches and techniques that will encourage engagement and enhance the level of discussion.</p>
<p>In particular, the program committee is actively seeking proposals for &ldquo;blank easel&rdquo; presentations for 2009 for up to 10 presentation slots. These facilitated discussion sessions will feature a presenter / moderator (one-three people) who will introduce a topic of relevance (and perhaps discussion points or an outline for discussion) and then engage all willing participants in a conversation around the topic. The sessions could describe and debate various futures for Ohio education, support and attack various instructional solutions to recurring educational problems, or offer new educational models that can be defended against the status quo. After all, the idea is &ldquo;a blank easel&rdquo; filled by session&rsquo;s end with provocative thoughts and calls to action.</p>
<p>Individuals interested in presenting in this format are encouraged to contact the track chairs with questions, suggestions, and fabulous, contentious ideas: <a href="mailto:acker.1@osu.edu">Steve Acker</a> / <a href="mailto:eugene.rutz@uc.edu">Eugene Rutz</a>.</p>
<h3>What&rsquo;s the Buzz? &ndash; Vendor Presentations</h3>
<p>New technologies and new partnerships are making possible approaches to learning and assessment that most of us can only just imagine. Companies that work with Ohio institutions are invited to present innovations that will benefit educators and students. Of particular interest are presentations that demonstrate new approaches toward achieving educational goals and inform the educational community of what can be accomplished. There are a limited number of presentation slots available so slots will be assigned as requested by paid vendors.</p>
<h2>Hands-On Workshops</h2>
<p>The conference provides a variety of opportunities for participants to develop new competencies in pedagogy and emerging areas of instructional technology. Pre-conference workshops provide a significant opportunity for this type of activity. Proposals are sought for topics to be presented in hands-on workshops during which participants will gain tangible new skills. Workshops are typically four to six hours in duration, are held the Sunday afternoon and evening prior to the main conference and provide significant interaction and learning for the participants.</p>
<p>Workshop topics that fit the theme of the conference are sought. The following suggested topics can serve as examples of workshop themes:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Instructional design that incorporates technology-enabled content;</li>
<li>Using social networks to communicate with and engage students;</li>
<li>Use of wikis for collaborative content development for a course or program;</li>
<li>Constructing learning opportunities in virtual environments;</li>
<li>Creating ePortfolios for novices.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main criteria for a workshop is that participants are provided the opportunity to develop a skill they can put to use immediately at their home institution.</p>
<h2>Submitting a Proposal</h2>
