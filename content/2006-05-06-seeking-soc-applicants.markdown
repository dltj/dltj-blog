  content: "Dearest Peter, I mean Jester:\r\n\r\nEvery time you update your RSS feed,
    the entire collection refreshes in my aggregator, plus your content looks funky--I
    see all these paragraph markers. I don't know if it's your blog or your feed,
    but something's amiss. \r\n\r\nKeep shaking that--er--whatever that thing is that
    jesters carry!"

  content: "[...] Although we were a little concerned right about this time last week,
    you came through with a wonderful suite of applications with OhioLINK as the mentoring
    organization for the Google Summer of Code. In the end, we are blown away not
    only by the increase in quantity over last year, but also the quality as well.
    We received seven for the video snapshot idea, five for the grid-based bulk video
    conversion tool, one each for the JPIP-based disseminator and applet client, plus
    a half-dozen proposals for things we didn&#8217;t have on our list. &#182; [...]"

<p>OhioLINK has received fewer applications for the <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/" title="Google Summer of Code - Google Code">Google Summer of Code</a> than last year and have a number of areas not yet covered by proposals.  Our <span class="removed_link" title="http://drc-dev.ohiolink.edu/wiki/ProjectIdeas">project ideas page</span> has suggestions related to applications we currently have under development, most dealing with applying JPEG 2000 to still image and moving image files.  We have also listed library-related projects for the Sakai collaboration and learning environment.</p>
<p>Google is sponsors the Summer of Code to "keep student's programming skills sharp" over the summer by pairing students with mentoring organizations to create open source applications.  OhioLINK is participating as a mentoring organization and welcomes applications for projects in the area of library services and information management.</p>
<p>In general, we work in the area of information retrieval, search result visualization, knowledge management, and automated description.  What is it that you wish your academic library did better?  Is it a 12 week project?  We're interested in hearing from you.
