<p>Coming out of the face-to-face meeting in Rutgers earlier this month, the <a href="http://oleproject.org/" title="http://oleproject.org">OLE Project</a> has posted a number of announcements for upcoming events.  The first is a webcast on Nov. 20, 2008 from 3:00pm to 4:30pm Eastern Standard Time, US, free of charge and open to anyone.  The webcast topics are:</p>
<ul type="disc">

There is a limit of 200 participants (the maximum the webcast service allows), and the session will be recorded for later playback.</p>

<h2>Regional Workshops</h2>
<p>The second is a series of regional workshops.  Tim McGeary, Senior Systems Specialist at Lehigh University, post news of these to several mailing lists:<br />
<blockquote>
The Open Library Environment (OLE, pronounced oh-lay) Project invites you to apply to participate in a two day Regional Design Workshop. The purpose of this workshop is to provide a forum for representatives of local research libraries and related institutions to discuss our work surrounding the current Integrated Library System and ideas on what this type of core system should incorporate. &nbsp;Workshops are being held in a variety of locations in the US over the next 2 months. For more information and to find a location near you, go to <span class="removed_link" title="http://oleproject.org/workshops">http://oleproject.org/workshops</span>.</p>
<p>Participation is open to any member of the research library community who works with the Integrated Library System either on a day to day basis or from a higher level. OLE will be developed as an open source library environment that meets the needs of research libraries. While care will be taken to design an open and flexible system that is useful for other types of libraries, such as public libraries, the focus of the project in this early stage is on research libraries.</p>
<p>The OLE project, with support from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_W._Mellon_Foundation" title="Andrew W. Mellon Foundation" rel="wikipedia" class="zem_slink">Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a>, seeks to convene the academic library community in the design of an Open Library Management System built using the principles of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture" title="Service-oriented architecture" rel="wikipedia" class="zem_slink">Service Oriented Architecture</a>. &nbsp;The project partners consist of leaders from academic libraries in the United States, Canada, and Australia dedicated to thinking beyond the current model of an Integrated Library System. &nbsp;We seek to design a new system that is flexible, customizable and able to meet the changing and complex needs of modern, dynamic academic libraries. &nbsp;The end product will be a design document to inform open source library system development efforts, to guide future library system implementations, and to influence current Integrated Library System vendor products.</p></blockquote>
