It is another e-books issue of <i><acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester">DLTJ</acronym> Thursday Threads</i> with updates on three significant efforts:  <a href="#p2768-hcod">HarperCollins</a>, <a href="#p2768-gbs">Google Book Search Settlement</a>, <a href="#p2768-dpla">Digital Public Library of America</a>.  And, just for fun and to keep this from turning into purely a legal and blue-sky policy blog, we have a video of <a href="#p2768-robotic-juggling">juggling robots</a>.

The past couple of weeks have seen more libraries and library consortia making decisions not to buy ebooks from HarperCollins after the 26-checkout limit came into force earlier this month.  The {{ robustlink(href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110401031916/http://www.libraryjournal.com/lj/home/889949-264/more_libraries_decide_to_give.html.csp", originalurl="http://www.libraryjournal.com/lj/home/889949-264/more_libraries_decide_to_give.html.csp", versiondate="2011-03-31", title="More Libraries Decide To Give HarperCollins the Cold Shoulder | Library Journal", anchor="article quoted above") }} from Tuesday gives the latest roundup.

Competitors to HarperCollins are {{ robustlink(href="https://abcclio.blogspot.com/2011/03/outrage-over-ebooks-stop-madness-and-we.html", versiondate="2011-03-31", title="Outrage over ebooks!

## The Google Settlement Rejection: What Comes Next? {: #p2768-gbs}

 blockquote='<p>When it was introduced in 2008, the Google Book Settlement was hailed by its creators as historic. Now, it is history. On March 22, after more than two years of contentious debate, Judge Denny Chin rejected the controversial proposal on copyright and antitrust grounds. A status conference is set for April 25 in New York, and the parties are free (and some say likely) to appeal the decision, though at press time no appeal had been announced.</p>
<p>Seen as the solution to a straightforward copyright claim lodged by authors and publishers against Google in 2005, the settlement offered a complex blueprint for a new digital book business, a $125 million legal puzzle that involved a dizzying array of moving parts: thousands of authors, millions of titles, libraries, the public interest, murky copyright law, orphan works, and even the creation of a new central rights authority, the Book Rights Registry, all of which appear to be off the table now.</p>
<p>PW takes a quick look at what the settlement&#039;s rejection means for the parties and other stakeholders.</p>',

Alright -- that quote is admittedly filled with a bunch of technical gobbledegook (I don't sound like that, do I?), but the video itself is pretty cool.  It is one minute long and shows one then two hovering robots juggle a ball to a height of what looks like about 20 feet.
