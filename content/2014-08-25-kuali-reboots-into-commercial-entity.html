  content: "I don't think that it ever was community source .. apart from in name
    only, it never really grew a community of developers. It certainly never was an
    open source project, even if the code was open source.\r\n\r\nIt's always been
    a top down, waterfall type approach to software dev, this is just moving it closer
    in line with it's proprietary cousins. \r\n\r\nThe cynic in me says they had probably
    gotten all the Mellon grants they were going to get, time to move to where they
    always wanted to be."

  content: From what I recall, each Kuali project found its own development path.  Some
    of the administrative functions were build with combined development teams from
    the partner universities.  In the case of OLE the first round of software development
    was outsourced to a specialized team.  I do think that style of development does
    make it harder for others to join in the development effort.  If the goal is to
    encourage as many diverse developers as possible to join -- as is one of the virtues
    of open source development -- any barrier to those developers is a risk to the
    project.

<p>Did you feel a great disturbance in the open source force last week?  At noon on Friday in a <a href="https://blog.kuali.org/?p=39">conference call with members of the Kuali community</a>, the Kuali Foundation Board of Directors announced a change of direction:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are pleased to share with you that the Kuali Foundation is creating a Professional Open Source commercial entity to help achieve these goals. We expect that this company will engage with the community to prioritize investments in Kuali products, will hire full-time personnel, will mesh a &ldquo;software startup&rdquo; with our current culture, and will, over time, become self-sustaining. It enables an additional path for investment to accelerate existing and create new Kuali products.</p></blockquote>
<p>As outlined in the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140826165041/https://blog.kuali.org/?p=37" title="Kuali 2.0 FAQs">Kuali 2.0 FAQ</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Kuali Foundation (.org) will still exist and will be a co-founder of the company. It will provide assurance of an ongoing open source code base and still enable members to pool funds to get special projects done that are outside the company&rsquo;s roadmap. The fees for Foundation membership will be reduced.</p></blockquote>
<p>There have been some great observations on Twitter this morning.  First, a series of tweets from Roger Schonfeld:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p>Community source models have proved inadequate to HighWire &amp; Kuali: both have reorganized as profit-seeking initiatives. 1/3&mdash; Roger C. Schonfeld (@rschon) <a href="https://twitter.com/rschon/statuses/503856316075356160">August 25, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p>As collaborative software/hosting specialized to higher ed, did they have trouble recapitalizing in the community following start up? 2/3&mdash; Roger C. Schonfeld (@rschon) <a href="https://twitter.com/rschon/statuses/503856887255670784">August 25, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p>And if so what should planners for other community collaborative initiatives such as HathiTrust bear in mind? 3/3&mdash; Roger C. Schonfeld (@rschon) <a href="https://twitter.com/rschon/statuses/503856936790417409">August 25, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Lisa Hinchliffe points out a similar struggle by the Sakai Foundation last year.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p>.<a href="https://twitter.com/rschon">@rschon</a>  Different path but perhaps also lessons from Sakai? <a href="http://t.co/YU739WA1oT" title="http://t.co/YU739WA1oT">http://t.co/YU739WA1oT</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Dan Cohen adds:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/DataG">@DataG</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/griffey">@griffey</a> Hmm, looks more radical than an &ldquo;adding a vendor&rdquo; move or even a Mozilla Foundation->Mozilla Corporation move.</p></blockquote>
<p>&mdash; Dan Cohen (@dancohen) <a href="https://twitter.com/dancohen/statuses/503895218497003521">August 25, 2014</a></p>
<p>And lastly (for the moment) Bryan Alexander adds a brief quote from Brad Wheeler's conference call:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/rschon">@rschon</a> Cf Brad Wheeler:  "college leaders perceive companies as more stable than communal projects"  <a href="https://twitter.com/dancohen">@dancohen</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/DataG">@DataG</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/griffey">@griffey</a></p></blockquote>
<p>&mdash; Bryan Alexander (@BryanAlexander) <a href="https://twitter.com/BryanAlexander/statuses/503899061418991616">August 25, 2014</a></p>
<p>My first interpretation of this is that there is a fundamental shift afoot in the perception of open source by senior leadership at higher education institutions.  Maybe it is a lack of faith in the "community source" model of software development.  Having a company out there that is formally responsible for the software rather than your own staff's sweat equity makes it easier to pin the blame for problems on someone else.  Or maybe it is that highly distributed open source projects for large enterprise-wide applications aren't feasible -- are communication barriers and the accountability overhead  too large to move fast?</p>
<p>I do wonder what this means for the Kuali Open Library Environment (OLE) project.  Kuali OLE just saw its first two installations go live this week.  Will Kuali's pivot towards a for-profit company make OLE more attractive to academic libraries or less?  Does it even matter?</p>
<p>Lots of questions, and lots to think about.</p>
