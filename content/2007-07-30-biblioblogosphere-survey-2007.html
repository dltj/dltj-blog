<p>Meredith Farkas is conducting a <a href="http://meredith.wolfwater.com/wordpress/index.php/2007/07/29/2007-survey-of-the-biblioblogosphere/" title="2007 Survey of the Biblioblogosphere&#039; posting on Information Wants To Be Free blog">survey of those in the library and information science profession who blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>After two years [since completing the <a href="http://meredith.wolfwater.com/wordpress/index.php/2005/09/12/survey-of-the-biblioblogosphere-results/" title="Survey of the Biblioblogosphere: Results&#039; posting on Information Wants To Be Free blog">first <i>Survey of the Biblioblogosphere</i></a>], it doesn&rsquo;t take a survey to see that the library blogosphere has changed a great deal. So many people now are blogging who would never have considered it two years ago. While I felt like I knew of most of the library blogs out there in 2005, I know that I probably barely know 1/10 of them today. Something that was once seen as incredibly risky to do (and still is depending on how you approach it) is now thought of as a way to make a name for yourself in the profession. The number of libraries that are blogging has exploded as well. All of these changes have made me very curious about what we&rsquo;d find today if we did the Survey of the Biblioblogosphere.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don't know how much uniqueness there is in my readership over Meredith's broad appeal, but if this is the first time you've heard of the Biblioblogosphere Survey and you blog about a topic in the library and/or information science arena, I encourage you to read her posting and take the survey.</p>
