Inspired by Tom Whitwell's [52 things I learned in 2022](https://medium.com/magnetic/52-things-i-learned-in-2022-db5fcd4aea6e), I started my own list of [things I learned in 2023]({filename}/2024-01-18-one-year-of-learning-2023). 
Reaching the end of another year, it is time for _Things I Learned In 2024:_
