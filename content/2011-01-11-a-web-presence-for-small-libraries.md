  content: "This sounds pretty cool, definitely seems to me to meet a need for small
    libraries, and sounds like it's got the right price point for them too. \r\n\r\nI'm
    surprised that you won't be attaching holdings for small libraries using the simple
    inventory system, since it does record an OCLCnumber, so holdings could be attached.
    Seems to me that it increases the value of OCLC's own business to know about as
    many holdings as possible; here you've got all the data to know about the holdings,
    why not attach them?\r\n\r\nI suspect you will need to provide custom domain name
    for this really to work; you could certainly charge an extra fee for the custom
    domain name. I think WordPress.com charges like $5 a year if you register the
    domain with someone else but point it to them, and something like $15 a year if
    they handle the registration for you too."

  content: "One of the key aspects is that libraries that use this service won't have
    to be members of OCLC, so there is no holding symbol to attach to a WorldCat record.
    \ Also, having to explain why holdings would show up in WorldCat might generate
    a call to the OCLC support center, and they want to avoid that at all costs.  (The
    cost of handling a call at the support center could easily run through the revenue
    received from the library at these price points.)\r\n\r\nIn the course of the
    discussion on Sunday, I think there was mention of considering another price tier
    between $5/month and $40/month that could include a custom domain name, but I
    didn't have that written down in my notes so I didn't include it in the description
    above.  The <a href=\"https://www.godaddy.com/domains/popups/icannfee.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">ICANN-mandated
    fee</a> is 18 cents per domain name per year, so anything layered on top of that
    would be the cost of running a DNS service.  It might be possible to find a white-label
    DNS provider that OCLC could contract with to register and maintain the domain
    names.  At least I imagine such things are possible, bud I don't know how one
    goes about doing it."

    On this project, Bruce Washburn from San Mateo did the UI design and coding.   The
    credit for the clean, modern design goes to him.  He has been working with us
    a lot in the Innovation Lab.\r\n\r\n I noticed that the Webjunction Link is wrong
    above...  http://www.webjunction.org/928 should be http://www.webjunction.org/923\r\n\r\nGreat
    comments from others...  It would be great for anyone with an idea go start a
    thread on the Webjunction group, especially the stuff on domain names.\r\n\r\nThe
    people in the pictures are all staff from the San Mateo office of OCLC."

  content: 'Re: DNS: You don''t neccesarily need to contract with any DNS provider,
    if you allow people to register their OWN dns names and point them at your service.
    Your service needs to be set up to deal with multiple hostnames, but you don''t
    need to have any involvement with registering them. Wordpress.com provides this
    as one option, for instance. DNS is set up to do that fine.  Of course, registering
    a DNS hostname and pointing it at an OCLC IP address, despite being just about
    the simplest network-related technical task there is, might still be too challenging
    for the target audience here. But I think it would be worth exploring, could be
    a LOT cheaper to support than doing the DNS registration yourself. Customer registers
    themselves with godaddy or the registrar of their choice, and just points the
    record at the IP address you tell them -- you could charge an additional fee even
    for allowing that, as wordpress.com does.'

  content: "True -- OCLC wouldn't have to contract with a DNS provider, but it would
    certainly make the process easier.  Perhaps the test should be along the lines
    of: \"If one could write a document that explains the process of registering a
    DNS name and assigning an address entry to OCLC's service in a way that my parents
    could understand without additional intervention, then it could be considered.\"
    \ That is a pretty high barrier, though.  Then you have the issue of domains expiring
    because the right person didn't pay the bill on time -- and would the library
    thing that is an OCLC issue and call the OCLC support desk...  \r\n\r\nFor the
    target audience, I think it would be best if OCLC did the whole soup-to-nuts process.
    \ I wonder, too, about search engine optimization -- if all of these libraries
    were served out of one domain then they could probably get some good <a href=\"http://google.about.com/od/g/g/google_juice.htm\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">Google Juice</a> from each other that would improve search results."

  content: "I did not attend ALA, but wanted to ask about existing records being pulled
    into the web site. How does that happen? Maybe that was discussed, but again I
    may have missed it. From personal experience with rural libraries, some of these
    folks have automated ILS systems and some don't. Some libraries are hanging on
    to their antiquated circulation systems with no support, which is scary because
    they could lose their data if they don't have a system to back up their records.
    Some libraries want to jump to another more reliable ILS, but do not have the
    funds to migrate. How this system help these libraries?\r\n\r\nThanks, Judy"

  content: Fabulous! I hope this project becomes a product. It's sorely needed. I've
    worked with small/rural libraries for 15 years, and developed a number of  "website
    in a box" projects in that time. And unfortunately, I think some of those libraries
    still have their 1997 FrontPage sites. So, for them to be able to have a modern
    web presence like this one, complete with mobile version... Wow! Worth it's weight
    in gold, which of course they don't have, so $60/year is perfect.

  content: "Judy -- what was demonstrated was a screen with eight very general fields
    (title, author, isbn, etc.).  The OCLC folks emphasized that the library inventory
    database is <em>not</em> the same as WorldCat, nor are holdings set in WorldCat
    for a library using this service.  If one entered the ISBN it was possible to
    look up that identifier in WorldCat and get some sort of mapping of WorldCat data
    to the eight general fields.  Willie also demonstrated the use of an Android smartphone
    application that would take a picture of the ISBN barcode on the back of a book,
    look up that ISBN in WorldCat, and insert the record into the library's inventory
    database.  In cases were the ISBN is looked up in WorldCat, the OCLC record number
    is kept in a hidden field, and it sounded like that might be used as a way to
    assist in migrating libraries to a more sophisticated integrated library system.\r\n\r\nIn
    case it wasn't clear by the description in this post, it is also possible to use
    this service along side an existing integrated library system.  The library could
    turn off the built-in inventory/circulation function of the website and create
    a hypertext link to its existing ILS service.  Migrating an ILS into the built-in
    inventory/circulation system is probably out-of-scope for the project, but you
    might want to ask the question in the <span class=\"removed_link\" title=\"http://www.webjunction.org/923/-/resources/discussion\">WebJunction
    forum</span> for an answer from someone directly connected to the project.\r\n\r\nPolly
    -- I agree!  I hope it works its way from \"project\" to \"product\" as well.<p

  content: "Here's wordpress.com's instructions:\r\n\r\nhttp://en.support.wordpress.com/domain-mapping/map-existing-domain/\r\n\r\nFor
    $17 a year you can have them register it for you and not need to follow those
    directions; for $12 a year you can register elsewhere and follow those directions.
    \r\n\r\nI think it's safe to say nobody is registering elsewhere to save the $5
    a year; those choosing the 'register elsewhere' option either already have a hostname
    registered elsewhere, or would like to register it elsewhere to ensure they maintain
    control of it rather than deputizing wordpress.com. \r\n\r\nNow, wordpress.com
    definitely has a lot bigger customer pool than even a wildly succesful Library
    in a Box from OCLC.  But if wordpress.com can do it for $17 a year... if OCLC
    can do it even for $60/year (extra $5 a month for the custom hostname),  I think
    that's still a fine price. If they start charging $20/month just for a custom
    hostname, I'll start to get suspicious though."

{{ image(float="right", width="317", localsrc="2011/01/Loremville-Public-Library_1294793741440.png", alt="Screenshot of Sample Library Website") }} 

On Sunday evening, the OCLC Innovation Lab held a {{ robustlink(href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110104195323/http://community.oclc.org/cooperative/2010/12/a-web-presence-for-every-library.html", original="http://community.oclc.org/cooperative/2010/12/a-web-presence-for-every-library.html", versiondate="2011-01-04", title="A Web presence for every library | The OCLC Cooperative Blog", anchor="public demonstration") }} of a project with the working title, {{ robustlink(href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120715010223/http://beta.worldcat.org/lib/-/-/public/home", original="http://beta.worldcat.org/lib/-/-/public/home", versiondate="2011-01-11", title="OCLC WSSL: WorldShare for Small Libraries", anchor="A Web Presence for Small Libraries") }}  It is a templated website that could serve as a library's barest bones presence on the web.  The target audience is small and/or rural libraries that may not have the technological infrastructure -- human knowledge, equipment, and/or money -- to host their own web presence.  If it comes to fruition, the basic service would give a library four pages on the web that can be customized by the library staff plus dynamic areas of content that would be generated by OCLC algorithms and optionally placed on each library's site.  A more advanced version of the service could include a light-weight book inventory and circulation option.

They created a sample library called Loremville, TN public library to demonstrate key aspects of the service.  I did not ask them how long that particular example will be around, so you may follow that link at a later date and not find it.

This "Library Website in a Box" is a concept that has been around for many years, and the latest trigger to try something was a resolution from the last OCLC Members Council to make scaled-down versions of OCLC services for "small and rural libraries."  The Innovation Lab group conducted some research about the existing state of public library web presences by sorting the {{ robustlink(href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101219021804/http://www.imls.gov/news/2010/063010.shtm", original="http://www.imls.gov/news/2010/063010.shtm", versiondate="2011-01-11", title="Public Library Visits, Circulation Spike While Staff Numbers Stay the Same: IMLS FY2008 Public Libraries Survey Report | IMLS", anchor="IMLS-reported data from 2008") }} IMLS-reported data from 2008 by number of volumes held and number of library staff.  They looked at the lowest quartile (roughly 20,000 volumes or less and staff size in the low single digits) and found that there was generally no web presence for these libraries.  In the second quartile there were instances of library websites, but they did the library no credit (outdated, poorly constructed, incomplete information -- as was said at the meeting, these libraries had a presence on the web but probably shouldn't).  Some had automation systems supplied by large groups, but others didn't have evidence of an automation system.  So the project charter was to find an easy and inexpensive way for a library in these quartiles to create a desktop and mobile device web presence.

One of the unique aspects of the project development was to first set the approximate lower ($5/month) and upper ($40/month) price boundaries and find a way to provide the highest level of service possible at those price points.  The Innovation Lab team tried techniques such as a farm of WordPress sites but found they couldn't make the revenue-versus-cost equation to work.  In the end they constructed a custom database-driven content system in PHP.  Institutional data is initially pulled from sources such as the {{ robustlink(href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101218092517/http://www.oclc.org/registry/default.htm", original="http://www.oclc.org/registry/default.htm", versiondate="2011-01-11", title="WorldCat Registry | OCLC Web Services", anchor="WorldCat Registry") }}, and there will be some process for a library to "claim" its site.  There might also be a way for a library to create a site for itself if no registry data yet exists.

There are four levels of site authorization:  public (unauthenticated) viewing, a registered patron, a staff member, and an administrator.  Content from the pages are edited by the administrator at the subscribing library with a WYSIWYG ((What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get, meaning as you edit the document with styles like bolding, underlining, and bulleted lists, what you see in the editing interface is exactly how it will appear in the viewing interface.)) editor.  There are content boxes for the library's location, staff/volunteers listing, events calendar and news, hours and phone number, policies, and service information.  The library's address is fed into a Google Maps service to display a map of the area surrounding the library.

The dynamic parts of each library's website could have a list of books from various sources like the New York Times and Oprah's book group.  The service also envisions offering a "default digital collection" using public domain works in text, PDF, and mobile reading device formats from sources such as Project Gutenberg and the Internet Archive.

The inventory and circulation module is simple and straight-forward.  Each item has only eight full-text fields with the intention that the description will likely be done by a volunteer without professional library training.  Cataloging can be done by typing in the information or scanning the ISBN with an app on a mobile device; item information is pulled from WorldCat if found.  The cataloging application does not attach holdings to WorldCat, but the OCLC number is kept and might be used to facilitate offloading MARC records in cases where a library outgrows this simple circulation module to a more functional integrated library system.  The circulation functions are check-in, check-out, renew, place hold and cancel hold.  There are no financial functions in the system.

At these price levels, the system needs to be highly automated and self-supporting.  The cost to OCLC of one call to a customer support phone number could easily run through all the revenue OCLC would receive from the subscribing library in a year.  A widely adopted implementation at the targeted price points means that OCLC could dedicate one or two technical staff to support and upgrade the system in addition to the hardware and support service amortization.

One unresolved issue is domain names -- what is the URL that will be used for each library's site.  OCLC is investigating options such as partnering with a domain registrar company (someone like GoDaddy), becoming a domain registrar themselves, or putting all the sites under one domain.  The economics of each of these options will be a factor. The sometimes cumbersome aspects of migrating domain names from one service to another may make that activity cost-prohibitive as well.

Mike Teets noted that this was at a "project" stage, not a "product" stage.  My paraphrasing of what this distinction means is that the technology to create a product is largely done, but the decisions on the final formative pieces of the technology and the surrounding support infrastructure -- is not yet done (and might never be done).  There isn't even a formal name for it yet; it is being called "A Web Presence for Small Libraries."  One desired additional feature is to add e-mail boxes for library staff/functions to the site.  Those in the room, including me but more importantly others who are more closely aligned with the target "small and rural" public library population, were pretty excited about it and wanting to talk further about if what we saw could be made a reality.


## Personal Impressions

Like others in the room, I came away impressed by the project demonstration.  It is definitely fits the bill as a basic library website and even a starter inventory and circulation management system.  I see that libraries could start with something like this for the cost of a couple of books added to the collection (roughly estimated at $60/year).  At this price level, OCLC thinks they could sustain the costs of operations plus have some left over for investment in incremental improvements.  I also think that because a library would pay a minimal fee for it, they would feel a tangible sense of ownership over the site and would keep them up-to-date.  From this a library could "graduate" to another service -- their own Drupal or WordPress site, to a shared ILS or Webscale Management Services.

The content areas seemed the most appropriate for the target audience.  The web page design is modern, and I could see options for future enhancements as time and revenue permit such as providing limited options to personalize the template (change colors, adding picture -- or adding links to pictures that might be stored on services such as Flickr).

One attendee at the session suggested that rather than OCLC prepopulating a digital content library of <em>all</em> public domain content that the set be {{ robustlink(href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110110165707/http://www.clicweb.org/e_discover/e_discovermarc.html", original="http://www.clicweb.org/e_discover/e_discovermarc.html", versiondate="2011-01-11", title="Importing MARC Records | Clicweb", anchor="limited to those that are most downloaded") }} so as not to overwhelm the user with a lot of unused (and/or unusable) digital content.  That sounds like a good suggestion to me.

OCLC Staff are looking for feedback on this project.  They say that the system is "production ready" with all the software controls and data recovery features of OCLC behind it.  What they think is missing is community support to have local engagement with the targeted libraries to show them what is possible.  That is an area where OCLC needs help.  (I can only imagine the shocked silence of a volunteer at a small library to get a call from OCLC -- if they even knew what OCLC was -- with an offer to create a website for the library.  "Only $5/month...sign up now and we'll throw in a second one for free!") There is an e-mail address -- <a href="mailto:innovation@oclc.org">innovation@oclc.org</a> -- that goes to all the OCLC Innovation Lab members, and a {{ robustlink(href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110109103152/http://www.webjunction.org/923", original="http://www.webjunction.org/923", versiondate="2011-01-11", title="Library Websites Group | WebJunction", anchor="WebJunction group") }}

## About the Innovation Lab

The OCLC Innovation Lab is a new unit headed up by Mike Teets.  The group has four full-time people (Mike plus {{ robustlink(href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100522102729/http://www.oclc.org/speakers/bios/house_tip.htm", original="http://www.oclc.org/speakers/bios/house_tip.htm", versiondate="2011-01-11", title="Tip House | OCLC", anchor="Tip House") }}, Rob Koopman and Willie Neumann) and leverage staff from other parts of OCLC to work on projects.  (Willie performed the demonstration at Midwinter.)  Their charge is to be a quick and nimble team to go after problems of a business unit of the cooperative or something from OCLC as a whole that wants done but hasn't made progress.  They like to use this quickness as a positive attribute to intentionally limit the scope of projects.  Since its formation in April 2010 it has come up with roughly one new thing a quarter, including the WorldCat Mobile interface (build in 22 days, Mike noted) and the {{ robustlink(href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100630163730/http://community.oclc.org/cooperative/2010/06/sometimes-the-internet-is-just-not-big-enough-for-me.html", versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20100630163730/http://community.oclc.org/cooperative/2010/06/sometimes-the-internet-is-just-not-big-enough-for-me.html", versiondate="2023-01-11", title="Sometimes the Internet is just not big enough for me | The OCLC Cooperative Blog", anchor="Ask4Stuff Twitter service") }}.

For this project, the Innovation Lab sought out cooperation from OCLC staff to build prototypes and components of the service in their spare time.  Each Monday the self-selected group would get together to show what had been built and discuss ways to move the project forward in the following week.  In this way they rapidly iterated over ideas to come up with what was ultimately proposed.
