  content: "What a great idea.\r\n\r\nWe had similar problems with the disk space
    requirements mushrooming for large collections, and the time required to generate
    the tiles for each new image. My solution was to not Zoomify the images (we use
    plain Jpeg) but make a custom Flash viewer using Actionscript that loads the entire
    file. With networks speeds being so fast it is feasible.\r\n\r\nBut now, you have
    given me an idea that it would be doable to also dynamically dish up Zoomify tiles
    for large Jpeg files server-side. Would need a simple Python script to do. I will
    add this to my TO-DO list... ;-)"

    working with are several 10s' of megabytes in size, so dumping them across the
    net to the browser isn't a great option for us.  I'd be curious to hear about
    how your script to generate the Zoomify tiles using Python works out; let me know!"

<p>This is a textual representation of a lightning talk done on Feb 26th at <a href="http://code4lib.org/conference/2008" title="Code4Lib 2008 Conference Homepage">Code4Lib 2008</a>.  <del datetime="2008-05-15T19:17:08+00:00">When the video of the talk is up (thanks, Noel!) I'll link it here, too.</del>  The video is <a href="/article/jpeg2000-to-zoomify-lightning-talk-video/">now available</a>, and that article includes an update on progress since the this article was posted.</p>
<p>OhioLINK has a collection of JPEG2000 images as an access format that were generated for use in our <a href="http://dlxs.org/" title="Digital Library eXtension Service homepage">DLXS</a>-based content system.  We are in the process of migrating those collections to DSpace and were looking for a mechanism to leverage the existing JPEG2000 files and not have to generate new derivatives.  We are also considering the use of JPEG2000 as a preservation format, and would find it attractive to use the same image format for both access copies and preservation copies.  We looked at Zoomify, but to perform its scaling function it generates JPEG tiles at several resolutions and storing those tiles can triple or quadruple disk space requirements.  Or, one could use the 'enterprise' version of Zoomify and its proprietary PFF format or the equally proprietary MrSID format.  We didn't want to be locked into either of these scenarios.  Our solution is to create a web application that mimics the directory-of-JPEG-tiles solution, but to dynamically generate the tiles our of a JPEG2000 master.</p>
<p>The free version of Zoomify reads JPEG tiles out of a directory structure that looks like this:</p>
<table cellpadding="3">
    </table>
<tr>
<td style="white-space: nowrap;" valign="top">/ImageProperties.xml</td>
<td>Includes descriptive elements of the source image like height, width, and tile size.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="white-space: nowrap" valign="top">/TileGroup0/0-0-0.jpg</td>
<td>The highest power-of-2 zoom out level that creates an image with dimensions less than 256x256</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="white-space: nowrap" valign="top">/TileGroup0/1-0-0.jpg</td>
<td>The tile at the upper left corner at the first power-of-2 zoom level</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="white-space: nowrap" valign="top">/TileGroup0/1-1-0.jpg</td>
<td>The tile to the left of 1-0-0.jpg</td>
</tr>
<p>The shim mimics that directory structure.  It parses the URL of the request and dynamically creates the appropriate JPEG tile (or metadata file) out of the JPEG2000 image.</p>
<h2>The Code</h2>
<p>The JPEG2000 for Zoomify shim requires <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/" title="Java Download page">Java</a> 1.5 or greater.  It does not require a servlet engine; rather, it uses the <a href="http://www.restlet.org/" title="Restlet project homepage">Restlet</a> library to perform as a stand-alone application.  The <a href="http://one-jar.sourceforge.net/" title="OneJar project homepage">OneJar</a> library allows the Java classes and required dependencies to be bundled into a single JAR file.  We're using the <a href="http://www.kakadusoftware.com/" title="Kakadu Software homepage">Kakadu Software JPEG2000 library</a> to perform the on-the-fly decoding of JPEG2000 images.  Kakadu is a commercial JPEG2000 codec, although <a href="http://www.kakadusoftware.com/index.php?option=com_virtuemart&amp;Itemid=19&amp;vmcchk=1&amp;Itemid=19" title="Kakadu Software purchasing and licensing guidelines">inexpensive licenses are available</a> for not-for-profit activity.  We are using the Enterprise version of <a href="http://www.zoomify.com/" title="Zoomify homepage">Zoomify</a>, a Flash-based image viewer, although I believe the free version will work as well.  (You'll need the Enterprise version to be able to modify and adapt the appearance of the Zoomify applet.)  The same techniques can also be used for other Flash applets and probably even JavaScript-based viewers (<i>a la</i> Google Maps).</p>
<p>The source code is available from the <span class="removed_link" title="https://drc-dev.ohiolink.edu/browser/j2kTileRenderer/trunk">OhioLINK DRC source code repository</span> (<span class="removed_link" title="https://drc-dev.ohiolink.edu/svn/j2kTileRenderer/trunk">Subversion access</span>).  We plan to integrate it into DSpace 1.5 as part of the <a href="http://info.drc.ohiolink.edu/" title="Ohio Digital Resource Commons | Save, Discover, and Share Your Resources and the Resources of the World">Ohio Digital Resource Commons</a>, and I may create a Fedora disseminator to serve up the tiles as well.</p>
<p>Thanks go out to Keith Gilbertson and John Davison on the OhioLINK staff for their help in making this work as well as Stu Hicks and Fran&ccedil;ois d'Erneville for being a sounding board for these ideas.</p>
