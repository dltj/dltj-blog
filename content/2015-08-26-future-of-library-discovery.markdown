<p>Helping patrons find the information they need is an important part of the library profession, and in the past decade the profession has seen the rise of dedicated "discovery systems" to address that need.  The National Information Standards Organization (<a href="http://www.niso.org/" title="Home - National Information Standards Organization">NISO</a>) is active at the intersection of libraries, content suppliers, and service providers in smoothing out the wrinkles between these parties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chartering the <a href="http://www.niso.org/workrooms/odi/" title="Open Discovery Initiative - National Information Standards Organization">Open Discovery Initiative</a> working group where these parties can come together</li>
<li>Commissioning a <a href="http://www.niso.org/news/pr/view?item_key=3e6b4a66b07a62f8ebe8b4b47739c48339ffd88c" title="NISO White Paper Explores the Future of Library Resource Discovery<br />
     - National Information Standards Organization">white paper</a> on the state and future direction of discovery systems</li>
</ul>
<p>Next in this effort is a two-day meeting where these three groups will hear about the latest activities and plan activities to advance the standards landscape.  Registration for this meeting has just opened, and included below is the announcement.  I'll be Baltimore in early October to participate and offer the closing keynote, and I hope you will be able to attend in person or participate in the live stream.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>    NISO will host a two&ndash;day meeting to take place in <strong>Baltimore, Maryland on October 5 &amp; 6, 2015</strong> on <a href="http://www.niso.org/news/events/2015/October_discovery/" title="NISO Forum: The Future of Library Resource Discovery - National Information Standards Organization"><strong>The Future of Library Discovery</strong></a>. In February 2015, NISO published a white paper commissioned from library consultant Marshall Breeding by NISO's Discovery to Delivery Topic Committee. The in-person meeting will be an extension of the white paper with a series of presenters and panels offering an overview of the current resource discovery environment. Attendees will then participate in several conversations that will examine possibilities regarding how these technologies, methodologies, and products might be able to adapt to changes in the evolving information landscape in scholarly communications and to take advantage of new technologies, metadata models, or linking environments to better accomplish the needs of libraries to provide access to resources.</p>
