<p>Thursday will be a big day in the Google Book Search lawsuit settlement:  the parties to the lawsuit, along with the objectors, supporters, and friends-of-the-court, will be in the courtroom of United States District Judge Denny Chin offering oral arguments in the final settlement/fairness hearing.  <a href="http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/new-york/nysdce/1:2005cv08136/273913/930/0.html" title="The Author's Guild et al v. Google Inc. Document 930 - :: Justia Docs">In his order</a>, Judge Chin recognized 26 parties that will speak for up to five minutes each on their positions in the settlement (21 in opposition, 5 in favor).  The U.S. Department of Justice will also speak at the hearing.  But I think we're all eagerly awaiting to hear what the judge himself will say about the settlement agreement.</p>
<p>In the lead-up to the hearing, Associate Professor <a href="http://james.grimmelmann.net/" title="James Grimmelmann homepage" rel="homepage">James Grimmelmann</a> at the New York Law School has continued <a href="http://laboratorium.net/" title="The Laboratorium">his efforts</a>, along with <a href="http://thepublicindex.org/about" title="About The Public Index">the students from the Institute for Information Law and Policy</a> at New York Law School, to make the documents and proceedings of the lawsuit accessible and understandable to non-lawyers.  In the most recent court filings leading up to Thursday's hearing are some interesting nuggets.<br />
<!--more--><br />
In his <a href="http://laboratorium.net/archive/2010/02/15/gbs_a_little_on_the_fee_motion" title="The Laboratorium: GBS: A Little on the Fee Motion">posting</a> on the <a href="http://thepublicindex.org/docs/amended_settlement/Motion_for_fees.pdf" title="Notice of Motion and Motion for Approval of Attorneys' Fees and Reimbursement of Costs">motion for attorneys fees</a>, he notes that "counsel for the author sub-class are asking for the full $30 million in fees and reimbursement of their out-of-pocket costs."  The filing contains information about the number of hours and the billing rate for some of the lawyers working on the case.  Some of the stuff is just really interesting, like <a href="http://thepublicindex.org/docs/amended_settlement/Dumain_Declaration.pdf" title="Declaration of Sanford P. Dumain in Support of Final Settlement Approval and Application of Counsel for the Author Sub-Class for Award of Fees and Reimbursement of Costs">one filing</a> that included everything from 18 hours by a partner of a firm (who is also a law professor at <acronym title="New York University">NYU</acronym>) at rate of $995/hour to an itemization of 51&cent; for long distance calls by the firm related to the case.  Whew!</p>
<p>More interesting to <acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester"><i>DLTJ</i></acronym> readers would be Grimmelmann's <a href="http://laboratorium.net/archive/2010/02/15/gbs_some_highlights_of_dan_clancys_declaration" title="GBS: Some Highlights of Dan Clancy's Declaration">highlights</a> of <a href="http://thepublicindex.org/docs/amended_settlement/dan_clancy_declaration.pdf" title="Declaration of Daniel Clancy in Support of Motion for Final Approval of Amended Settlement Agreement">Dan Clancy's declaration</a> in support of the agreement.  <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102702332" title="Dan Clancy - Computer History Museum - Events">Dan Clancy</a> is engineering director of the Google Book Search project, so he has a unique insight into the inner workings.  Grimmlemann notes that Clancy states:
<ul type="square">
<li>To date, Google has Digitized over twelve million books, and intends to continue Digitizing books in the future.</li>
<li>Google has received metadata from 48 libraries.</li>
<li>Google pays approximately $2.5 million per year to license metadata from 21 commercial databases of information about books.</li>
<li>Google has gathered 3.27 billion records about Books, and analyzed them to identify more than 174 million unique works.</li>
</ul>
<p>The third bullet is interesting in that I think we can eliminate one of the "commercial databases" from the list.  I can't find it in my notes from ALA Midwinter, but I seem to recall hearing <a href="http://www.oclc.org/about/trustees/members/jay_jordan.htm" title="Jay Jordan [OCLC - 2009-2010 Board members]">Jay Jordan</a> (<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jay-jordan/0/495/86" title="Jay Jordan - LinkedIn">OCLC President</a>) say something along the lines that OCLC was not receiving a monetary return from the sharing of bibliographic data with Google; the value OCLC gets for its membership comes from the links back to WorldCat from Google services.  If I got this wrong, I hope someone from OCLC will call me out on it.</p>
<p>The last bullet is interesting, too:  Google has identifying 174 million works in analyzing all of the sources of data coming into it.  I tried to find some numbers in the descriptions of WorldCat to compare that to, but didn't have any luck this evening.  (There isn't anything about statistics available on <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/" title="WorldCat Homepage" rel="homepage">http://worldcat.org/</a>?)</p>
<p>To Grimmelmann's highlights I would add this statement that seems strangely out-of-place.</p>
<ul type="square">
<li>Google has no interest in censorship. Indeed, Google's mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.</li>
</ul>
<p>Has anyone brought censorship into the discussion yet?  Privacy for sure, but censorship?</p>
<p>Also:
<ul type="square">
<li>Google has developed algorithms to compare these numerous sources of metadata and identify the most accurate data about each book.</li>
</ul>
<p>They certainly seem to have invested a lot of effort in this area.  More info can be found in <a href="/article/mashups-of-bib-data/">my summary of Kurt Groetsch's presentation at ALA Midwinter 2010</a>.
