  content: Thank you for sharing this. This is exactly the type of marketing strategy
    libraries need to get ahead. I use proprietary, but premium sounds better. Trying
    to find a way to translate free content through the library databases is very
    tricky.

  content: You're welcome, Jeff.  I, too, think <em>premium</em> sounds better than
    <em>proprietary</em> because of the dual value-add connotations of <em>premium</em>.  (Both
    the commercial -- proprietary -- resources and the curated resources we create
    ourselves.)  You're right...the notion of <strong>adding value</strong>, a marketing
    function of sorts, is the kind of thing we need to do to make our services seem
    indispensable to our patrons.

  content: Nice. Looks like they're using a meta-search product there. Can you tell
    which one? Just curious. I guess most public libraries use WebFeat?

    hosted instance of WebFeat, based on the contents and structure of the URL of
    the advanced search page (www.columbuslibrary.org/ebranch/index.cfm?pageid=177&#038;url=http://wfxsearch.webfeat.org/wfsearch/search?cid=10383&#038;t=qs\")."

<p>I love my local public library system, the <a href="http://www.columbuslibrary.org/" title="Columbus Metropolitan Library Homepage">Columbus Metropolitan Library</a>.  I'm a big fan of its helpful staff, plentiful collections, and convenient delivery service.  Today I appaud it for coming up with what I think is the best terminology for our patrons to understand what we mean when we say databases.  <img src="/assets/images/2007/09/BeyondGoogle.png" alt="CML&#039;s &#039;Beyond Google&#039; Box" width="362" height="108" border="0" style="float:right; padding: 15px 0 15px 20px;" />  In a box on their homepage with the heading "Beyond Google" the CML says "Your library card is all you need to access our <strong>premium online resources</strong>!"  What a great phrase for those things  -- premium online resources.  By using the word "premium," this phrase points out the notion that these are things with added value.  That added value may come from the fact that the resources are licensed and are therefore beyond what you would get just looking at the open web.  Or it could mean that it is a curated collection created and offered to the open web by the library itself.  Some may waver over the use of the word "resources" but I think that is a meaningful phrase<br clear="all" /></p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2007/09/findItBox.png" alt="CML&#039;s metasearch form" title="CML&#039;s metasearch form" width="262" height="122" border="0" style="float:left; padding: 0 20px 15px 0;" /> To really see this phrase in action, though, take a look at how it appears in their metasearch form.  There are two radio buttons -- one for the "catalog" (which is also a <a href="http://catalog.clcohio.org/polaris/Search/default.aspx?ctx=49.1033.0.0.14" title="Columbus Metropolitan Library&#039;s public catalog">link to their home-grown ILS</a>) and one for "premium resources" (which links to an <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.columbuslibrary.org/ebranch/index.cfm?pageid=18&amp;parentid=855">alphabetical list of databases</span>).  With the heading "Find It" and its positioning in the upper left corner of every page, this search form really gets to the heart of the information discovery in today's libraries.</p>
<p>Way to go, CML!<br clear="all" /></p>
