<p>There are just a few days left to respond to the "<a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.asp?u=621703504304" title="">International Digital Preservation Systems Survey</a>" being run by Karim Boughida and Sally Hubbard from the <a href="http://www.getty.edu/research/" title="The Getty Research Institute">Getty Research Institute</a>.  From the survey description:</p>
<blockquote><p>
This survey is intended to provide an overview of digital preservation system (DPS) implementation.  DPS is defined here as an assembly of computer hardware, software and policies equivalent to a TDR (trusted digital repository) &ldquo;whose mission is to provide reliable, long-term access to managed digital resources to its designated community, now, and in the future&rdquo;<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>The survey was produced by the Getty Research Institute departments of Digital Resource Management and Library Information Systems, and will be distributed primarily among members of the Digital Library Federation (DLF).  Results will be shared at the DLF Spring Forum, April 23-25, 2007, and with all respondents who provide contact information.</p>
<p>Please respond by March 30, 2007.</p>

<p>This month has been an explosion of news for repository systems focused on digital preservation.  First was the <a href="http://www.repositoryaudit.eu/" title="DCC/DPE Digital Repository Audit Method Based on Risk Assessment homepage">Digital Repository Audit Method Based on Risk Assessment</a> report and worksheet from <a href="http://www.dcc.ac.uk/" title="Digital Curation Centre homepage">Digital Curation Centre</a> (DCC) in the UK and <a href="http://www.digitalpreservationeurope.eu/" title="DPE: Digital Preservation Europe homepage">DigitalPreservationEurope</a> (DPE).  The second was the <a href="http://bibpurl.oclc.org/web/16712" title="">Trustworthy Repositories Audit & Certification (TRAC): Criteria and Checklist</a> from the <a href="http://www.crl.edu/" title="Center for Research Libraries homepage">Center for Research Libraries</a> (CRL), <a href="http://www.oclc.org/" title="OCLC homepage">OCLC/RLG</a>, and <a href="http://www.archives.gov/" title="U.S. National Archives and Records Administration homepage">U.S. National Archives and Records Administration</a> (NARA).  I haven't had a chance to digest these two documents, but I'm looking forward to doing that plus the publication of the results of this survey from Getty.</p>
