  content: Marlyn -- that book has a very recent publication date (2000) so the text
    of it is not in the public domain.  I was unable to find a record of it in the
    Worldcat world-wide library database.  Good luck with your search.

<p>Why settle for mere digital copies of books (<i>a la</i> the <a href="http://books.google.com/" title="Google Book Search">Google Book Search project</a> and the <a href="http://www.opencontentalliance.org/" title="Open Content Alliance homepage">Open Content Alliance</a>) when you can have an edition printed, bound and sent to you in the mail?  That's the twist behind a recent partnership announced by <a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&#038;p=irol-newsArticle&#038;ID=1018605&#038;highlight=" title="Amazon press release">Amazon.com</a>, <a href="http://www.kirtas-tech.com/News.asp" title="Kirtas news page">Kirtas Technologies</a>, <a href="http://www.emory.edu/news/Releases/KirtasPartnership1181162558.html" title="Emory University News Release - Kirtas Partnership">Emory University</a>, University of Maine, Toronto Public Library, and the Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County.  </p>
<p>More information via <a href="http://news.com.com/8301-10784_3-9732767-7.html" title="CNET News.com article &#039;Amazon enters book digitization jungle with rare-book project&#039;">C|Net News</a>, <a href="http://chronicle.com/weekly/v53/i44/44a02701.htm" title="Chronicle of Higher Education article">The Chronicle of Higher Education</a> (subscription required), and <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2007/06/22/digitize" title="Inside Higher Ed article &#039;An Alternative to Google&#039;">Inside Higher Ed</a>.  I'm putting this in the "Disruption in Libraries" category because it is an example of using a technical innovation to serve an un-served or under-served population -- not only the digitization of books but also the ability to deliver a physical reproduction to the user.  That aspect makes this program distinct from the others, and it is the first time that we've seen a glimpse of a reasonable business model:  costs recovered and profits made that go back into the digitization program for new books.  Since this is a non-exclusive agreement that puts the libraries in control, the texts can be made available freely online or available at a nominal cost to the user in a physical form.</p>
<p>[Update 20070704T0904 : Ack!  I linked to the wrong Chronicle of Higher Ed article.  Fixed now -- thanks Jodi.]
