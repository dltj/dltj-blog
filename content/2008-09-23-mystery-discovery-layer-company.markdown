  content: "Hmmm...my first guess was OCLC, right off the bat.  Has the age, has the
    clout, has WorldCat.  But WC can be mashed up.  Obviously , the person who wrote
    the survey is clueless- what user cares if the OPAC is OS?  Who would ask?\r\n\r\nThe
    question about how much of a price increase was bizarre - either a declaration
    that we don't have the product yet, or that they're dishonest and seeking big
    bucks.  Of course, the fact that you're dismissed if you don't claim to be from
    a large library and have considerable influence over purchasing hints that way.\r\n\r\nNext
    question is, who would have this kind of survey done?  I think the big dogs are
    a little more sophisticated than this survey is.  I would fire a research team
    that used this as a starting point for marketing or development.  I totally made
    up my \"library\", no check that I wasn't don saklad.\r\n\r\nI almost felt like
    it was a Turing test.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that it's a flagpole - someone has a
    fairly bright idea - a Google Scholar/Books/WC mashup that filters by your subscriptions.
    \ They run a \"survey\" to see what the market will bear before looking for venture
    capital or taking it to a big dog and trying to sell it.  Too many red flags to
    be someone with \"decades\" of experience, too many business terms (ROI on a OPAC?),
    just doesn't smell right.  Even the Amazon certificates doesn't ring true.\r\n\r\nI'll
    be curious to see what shows up in my spam mailbox ; )\r\n\r\ns"

  content: "Good thoughts, Susan.  I thought some of the questions in the survey were
    sort of bazaar, too.  It was asking me to evaluate a product based on a textual
    description of what they want you to think it is plus a screenshot.  (Which is
    one of the reasons why I wanted to have a more in-depth conversation with this
    entity.)  I wasn't as put off by the financial questions -- it just sounded like
    overt techniques to figure out exactly what the market will tolerate for a product
    like this.  And I, too, had to fib about my organization (\"consortial office\"
    wasn't a choice for classification of my employer) so as not to be dismissed after
    the first screen.\r\n\r\nAlso, in case it needs to be explicitly mentioned, the
    sponsoring organization is welcome to out itself here or contact me privately
    for an off-the-record conversation."

  content: "It could be Serials Solutions / WebFeat, but I don't think Serials Solutions
    has much in the way of experience with large indexes of actual content.  As I
    recall, the survey spoke of a pre-computed index solution over a federated-only
    solution, so it would potentially be a big leap in capability for them.\r\n\r\nI
    also took a look at the picture of the building, but thought it was just generic
    artwork rather than a picture of the actual entity creating this."

<p>There is a message floating around the net with a link to a survey about "a completely new online resource discovery service."  There is no identifying information information on the survey; obviously the entity that commissioned it wants to remain private.  I, however, want to know who this organization is.  (I have some questions to ask.)  Think of it as a game -- a treasure hunt of sorts.  Speculations welcome, either <a href="/article/mystery-discovery-layer-company/#respond">publicly in the comments</a> or <a href="/contact/">privately</a>.</p>
<p>The message going around says:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Subject:</i> REMINDER: Take a library survey &ndash; you may earn a $100 Amazon voucher</p>
<p>If you haven't already done so, please participate in our 15-minute web survey and be entered to win one of five $100 Amazon gift certificates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="removed_link" title="http://www.amrsurvey.com/7410">www.amrsurvey.com/7410</span></p>
<p>We'd like your feedback on the potential value of a completely new online resource discovery service for libraries. All you need to do is click on the link and answer our brief survey.</p>
<p>Winners will receive their $100 Amazon gift certificate via email by midnight September 30th 2008.</p>

<p>The survey itself contains a description of the entity conducting the survey and a sample screenshot of the new discovery layer being tested:</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_505" align="alignright" width="300" caption="Screenshot from the Survey's Prototype Discovery Tool"]<a href="/article/mystery-discovery-layer-company/screenshot/" rel="attachment wp-att-505"><img src="/assets/images/2008/09/screenshot-300x227.png" alt="Screenshot from the Survey&#039;s Prototype Discovery Tool" title="Screenshot from the Survey&#039;s Prototype Discovery Tool" width="300" height="227" class="size-medium wp-image-505" /></a>[/caption]<br />
<blockquote>ABOUT THE VENDOR</p>
<p>This new discovery service is offered by a major vendor that has been exclusively serving libraries for a matter of decades. This vendor has:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Extensive expertise in large-scale hosted search</li>
<li>Experience in the quality treatment of scholarly content and its metadata</li>
<li>Market recognition for consistently designing interfaces with users in mind</li>
<li>Excellent, long-term relationships with thousands of publishers</li>
<li>Deep knowledge of library e-resources</li>
<li>Trusted, longstanding reputation for superior customer service</li>
</ul>
<p>PRICING</p>
<p>The exact annual subscription rate for this discovery service would depend primarily on your enrollment/FTE.</p>
<p>These costs are still being developed, but an initial estimate for institutions like yours is <i>$xxx</i> per year, plus a one-time installation fee of <i>$xxx</i>.</p>
<p>The vendor believes that the subscription cost would be offset by savings from no longer needing to have a federated search product nor any hardware or maintenance associated with it.</p></blockquote>
<p>The e-mail was sent out through what looks like a standard commercial bulk emailer (like the kind that send out corporate newsletters and advertisements).  The <code>amrsurvey.com</code> domain is <a href="http://secure.dotearth.com/cgi-bin/www.dotearth.com/verify-whois.cgi?member=&amp;site=&amp;promo=&amp;sessid=&amp;domain=amrsurvey&amp;type=com&amp;FormsButton1=Search" title="us_whoissearch_template">registered to an entity called Action Market Research</a>, so that isn't much help. Thoughts about who is sponsoring this survey?
