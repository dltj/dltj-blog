<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/ALA_Chicago_09_Logo.jpg" alt="ALA Annual 2000 Logo" class="alignright" height="135" width="91" />The <a href="http://link.ixs1.net/s/ve?eli=y313998&amp;si=r98421464&amp;cfc=3html" title="American Libraries Direct for 11-Feb-2009">latest edition of <i>American Libraries Direct</i></a> published today has a story about an <a href="http://wikis.ala.org/annual2009/index.php/Unconference" title="ALA Annual 2009 Unconference">unconference</a> that precedes the ALA Annual conference in Chicago this July:</p>
<blockquote><p>Are you interested in attending a conference program where you have a hand in determining the topics discussed? Have you always wondered what really goes on at an unconference? As part of ALA President Jim Rettig&rsquo;s &ldquo;Creating Connections&rdquo; initiatives, 75 conference attendees will have the opportunity to participate in a free <a href="http://wikis.ala.org/annual2009/index.php/Unconference" title="ALA Annual 2009 Unconference">unconference</a> July 10 at the 2009 ALA Annual Conference in Chicago....</p></blockquote>
<p>Attendance is limited to 75 people, and there is an <a href="http://wikis.ala.org/annual2009/index.php/Unconference_Registration" title="ALA Annual 2009 Unconference Registration">online registration wiki page</a> to signal that you are coming.  (You'll need to <a href="http://wikis.ala.org/annual2009/index.php?title=Special:Userlogin&amp;type=signup" title="ALA Annual 2009 Wiki Registration">register for the ALA Annual 2009 Wiki</a> before editing the page.)</p>
<p>This is an interesting experiment -- kudos to ALA for trying it out.</p>
