<p><a href="http://www.ksu.edu/sasw/anthro/wesch.htm" title="Dr. Michael Wesch&#039;s homepage">Dr. Michael Wesch</a>, a cultural anthropologist dubbed <a href="http://archive.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/multimedia/2007/04/ss_raves?slide=14" title="Michael Wesch at the 2007 Rave Awards">&ldquo;the explainer&rdquo; by Wired magazine</a>, will give the keynote address &ldquo;Mediated Culture: Tales from New Guinea, New Media and New Experiments in Learning&rdquo; on Monday, March 2, at the University System of Ohio&rsquo;s Learning, Libraries &amp; Technology Conference 2009.</p>
<p>Using examples from fieldwork in Papua New Guinea, YouTube and "the future," this presentation will demonstrate the profound ways in which media are pervasive in our lives, mediating our relationships in ways we often do not recognize. Dr. Wesch will showcase and discuss his own attempts to leverage new media to create new forms of community and conversation to enhance learning and create a rich virtual learning environment.
