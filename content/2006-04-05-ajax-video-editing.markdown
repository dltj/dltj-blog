This is amazing stuff -- an AJAX-based video editing tool...<i>in your web browser!</i>  I haven't looked at the underlying technology or it's licensing terms (the message announcing it says that it is tied to the <a href="http://eyespot.com/">'eyespot' service</a>) but it may be possible to port this to a generic repository.  If so, this poses some exiting possibilities for the DRC!</p>

<h1>Editing video in your browser? Try eyespot - the AJAX video editor</h1>
<p style="font-weight: 800;">April 5th, 2006</p>
<p>Each week at ajaxLaunch, we're announcing a new ajax program designed to shatter what people think is possible. In the last two weeks I announced ajaxWrite and ajaxSketch. These programs were significant because they load in seconds via a web browser, but look and operate like traditional applications. Amazing technology, but hardly fun. Today, I'm announcing something amazing and fun - video editing. Yes, video editing ajax style - in a web browser like you have never seen before.</p>
