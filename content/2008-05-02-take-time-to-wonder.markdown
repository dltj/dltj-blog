  content: Hopefully the "tagging" part of the meme is the least important. I almost
    left three "free tags" but then hunted around to find people who I read who I
    consider deep and wonderful thinkers/writers. That includes you, but I honestly
    didn't imagine you writing such a personal post -- it's very touching!

    an exception :> )"

  content: Your instincts are correct, Karen.  A personal post like this is definitely
    out of character for me and <acronymDisruptive Library Technology Jester"><i>DLTJ</i></acronym>.  I
    was moved by the previous contributions, though (isn't that part of the point
    of a good meme?) -- moved enough to overcome inhibitions of family privacy desires.  Besides,
    it is one of my most favorite pictures of my daughter, and I couldn't help but
    share it.

<p>I found <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.edsupport.cc/mguhlin/archives/2008/02/entry_6578.htm">this meme</span> via <a href="http://freerangelibrarian.com/2008/05/02/reading-sets-you-free/" title="63<br />
  Passion Quilt Meme: Reading Sets You Free">Karen Schneider's entry</a>.  Although I wasn't explicitly tagged, I thought it was interesting enough to add an entry to the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/passionquilt/pool/" title="Flickr: The Passion Quilt Pool">meme's Flikr pool</a>.</p>
<p>With all due respect to Karen -- and I agree that a love of reading is important -- but it is a sense of wonder that encourages a love of reading and all sorts of other critical character traits.  This is a picture of my daughter when she was about three years old.  She is on the back deck of our Connecticut house watching a caterpillar crawl up our gate.  She loves to read (and now three years later is reading scores of books on horses and dolphins from the elementary school library), and as her father I hope the same sense of curiosity will sustain her love for reading, arts, sciences, and life.</p>
<p>Since I wasn't tagged, I'm not inflicting the meme on anyone else.
