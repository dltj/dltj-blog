    some of what I&rsquo;ve heard lately, including on Monday at the workshop, makes
    me despair that one is coming. After Peter Murray&rsquo;s utterly brillianttalk
    on intervention in digital workflowsas the &ldquo;fourth wave&rdquo; of library
    work (er, that was a spoiler, wasn&rsquo;t it? oh well), an audience member asked
    with a certain amount of Gormanesque hauteur whether intervening in faculty digital
    workflows was really consonant with the library<!--%kramer-post%-->"

<p>On Monday, I had the honor and pleasure of speaking at the <a href="http://www.niso.org/news/events/niso/past/ir07/agenda.html" title="Workshop agenda for NISO&#039;s &#039;Getting the Most Out of Your Institutional Repository: Gathering Content and Building Use&#039;"><acronym title="National Information Standards Organization">NISO</acronym> workshop "Getting the Most Out of Your Institutional Repository"</a> on the topic of The Third Wave of Library Information Stewardship.  The presentation abstract was: </p>
<blockquote><p>[Academic] Libraries are gearing up for the third wave of information under our stewardship. In the first wave, libraries purchased, made discoverable, and managed information from commercial sources in physical forms (e.g., paper-bound monographs, traditional serials, and microform archives). In the second wave, libraries licensed, made discoverable, and supported information from commercial sources in digital form (e.g., electronic journals, index/abstract databases, and image collections).</p>
<p>Libraries are now entering the third wave: selecting, publishing, and curating locally-produced digital content (institutional repositories, pre-print archives, and other locally unique collections). In this third wave, we need the skills and techniques of all of the previous stages, plus a need to learn a few new tricks. This presentation offers an overview of the selection, publication, and curation of locally-produced digital content. The speaker will also end with a glimpse of the fourth wave.</p></blockquote>
<p>This <acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester"><i>DLTJ</i></acronym> posting is a placeholder for a link to the anticipated recording of the presentation (I'll update the page when the recording is available) and as a place for attendees to offer comments on the talk.  I'll create a separate posting for my impressions of the meeting and what I learned from the other presenters.</p>
<p>One correction I must make:  I gave the conference organizers an older version of my biographical statement.  It said that I was heading a project called the Digital Resource Commons that is bringing hosted repositories to OhioLINK members.  That <em>(insert one or more of of:  mission, honor, duty, challenge, responsibility, dream, nightmare...)</em> is now in the extraordinarily capable hands of John Davison on the OhioLINK staff.  Content repositories at institutions (which, as I said in my talk, shouldn't necessarily be equated to "institutional repositories" as we know them now) remains a key professional interest and activity, just not with the awesome <em>(insert another word from the list above)</em> of running the project.  ((See the "<a href="/article/new-title-new-challenges/">New Title, New Challenges</a>" posting from earlier this year for more background on the job change.))
