<p>The Columbus Metropolitan Library, OCLC, and Ohio State University and OhioLINK have put in a bid as host site for the 2009 Code4Lib meeting.  <a href="http://code4lib.org/" title="Code for Libraries homepage">Code4Lib</a> is an informal organization of self-selected librarians and technology professionals.  It exists as a volunteer organization run by consensus of interested individuals.  The meeting in 2009 will be the <strike>fifth</strike> fourth ((Thanks for the correction, Mike!)) face-to-face meeting of this group.  Details of the central Ohio host location proposal are on the web at <a href="http://roytennant.com/code4lib2009.html" title="Code4lib 2009 Proposal: Columbus, OH">http://roytennant.com/code4lib2009.html</a></p>
<p>Information about becoming a member of the Code4Lib community and voting in the host site selection process are included below.</p>
<p>The meeting is conducted in an "unconference" or "barCamp" format.  It is a highly democratic style consisting of prepared talks, "lightning talks" (described below) and breakouts; the meeting schedule is divided almost equally between these three components.  Prepared talks are 20 minutes long and are proposed by speakers prior to the meeting.  Proposals are voted on by the entire Code4Lib community, and the highest ranking ones are slotted into the schedule.  "Lightning talks" are 5 minutes long and are assigned on a first-come, first-scheduled basis at the start of the meeting.  Prepared talks and lightning talks are presented to the entire attendee body (e.g. a single-track meeting); they are also usually recorded and published to the web after the meeting.  Time slots for breakouts are built into the schedule and rooms are provided by the conference organizers.  Attendees create breakout sessions at the meeting on any topic on a first-come, first-scheduled basis.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about Code4Lib in general or the central Ohio site proposal in particular, please <a href="/contact/">let me know</a>.</p>
