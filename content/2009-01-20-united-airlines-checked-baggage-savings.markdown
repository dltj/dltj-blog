  content: It seems they are always making changes to their policies. I think it would
    be nice if they could keep a standard, instead of having to learn of a new rule
    every time I go to the airport.

<p>United Airlines, along with many other carriers, has <a href="http://www.united.com/page/article/0,6722,52481,00.html?navSource=SidebarPromo&amp;linkTitle=UPDATED%3A+Checked+baggage+policy&amp;pos=1&amp;date=2009/01/12&amp;time=13" title="United Airlines - U.S./Canada checked baggage">instituted a policy of charging for checked luggage</a>.  For United, the first bag is $15 and subsequent bags are $25 each.  If you check-in for your flight online between now and January 31st, however, you can save $3 <del datetime="2009-01-22T02:03:38+00:00">on each</del> the first bag.  The online check-in process asks for your credit card to complete the transaction.  You can also print your boarding pass during the check-in process.  When you get to the airport, use the self-service kiosks to start your check-in process again.  The baggage tag will then automatically print behind the counter and you'll soon be on your way.</p>
<p>This might be old news for some -- it has been two years since I've been on a flight when I had to check a bag -- but a combined 8-day trip of the OLE project in Lehigh University and the Midwinter meeting in Denver means I'll be out longer than the typical carry-on bag will allow.  Still scheme for charging for bags based on a day's flight activity seems a bit foreign to me.  The $15-per-day's-itinerary doesn't correlate to any actual charges I can think of.  If the main cost of handling checked bags was for the additional labor of handling them, I would expect charges for each <em>segment</em> of a day's itinerary.  Likewise, if the charge is to handle the additional cost of fuel to transport the checked bag, it would make sense for the charge to be by segment.  So as near as I can figure out, with 15 minutes of thinking about the topic, the added baggage charge doesn't really reflect the cost of actually transporting the bag and is just a way to collect more money.</p>
