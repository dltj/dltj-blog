> The panopticon is a disciplinary concept brought to life in the form of a central observation tower placed within a circle of prison cells. From the tower, a guard can see every cell and inmate but the inmates can’t see into the tower. Prisoners will never know whether or not they are being watched.

 anchor="Data brokers are gearing up to fight privacy bills: A congressional showdown over data brokers could affect domestic surveillance capabilities",
 post=", The Verge") }}

LexisNexis, a data analytics firm, is becoming involved in the ongoing debate over privacy and data broker regulations as Congress considers reauthorizing Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Recently, the House passed a bill aimed at preventing the sale of Americans' data to foreign adversaries, but discussions around privacy amendments have created significant contention. One proposed amendment would prohibit data brokers from selling consumer data to law enforcement without a warrant, which has faced opposition from national security advocates and law enforcement groups. The National Sheriffs Association expressed strong disapproval of the amendment, stating it could undermine law enforcement efforts. With the deadline for FISA reauthorization approaching, lawmakers are likely to revisit these privacy issues, with some indicating they may not support the bill without the amendments. In response to the legislative developments, LexisNexis's parent company, Relx, has engaged a lobbying firm to influence the outcome. The company has faced scrutiny for its data collection practices, particularly regarding its partnerships with automakers to sell driving data to insurance companies. This situation highlights the broader implications of data privacy legislation on surveillance capabilities and the interests of data brokers.

Apple is pursuing legal action against the UK government over a demand to access its customers' private data. The company has appealed to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal after receiving a secret order from the Home Office in January, which would require Apple to share encrypted data with UK law enforcement in cases of national security threats. While Apple can still access data protected by its standard encryption with a warrant, its Advanced Data Protection (ADP) feature, which offers stronger privacy, cannot be accessed even by Apple itself. In response to the UK order, Apple has removed ADP from the UK market rather than create a "backdoor" for access. The situation has sparked tension between Apple and the UK government, with the US administration expressing concern over the UK's actions. US intelligence officials were reportedly not informed about the UK's demand, leading to accusations of violating citizens' privacy rights. The Home Office maintains that privacy is only compromised in exceptional cases related to serious crimes. Apple's legal case may be heard soon, but details are likely to remain confidential.

 anchor="NYPD spent millions to contract with firm banned by Meta for fake profiles: Documents show authorities bought Voyager Lab products which the company claims can use AI to map online human behavior",
 post=", The Guardian") }}

The New York Police Department (NYPD) has spent millions on a contract with Voyager Labs, a surveillance firm banned by Meta for using fake profiles to scrape social media data. Documents obtained reveal that the NYPD entered a nearly $9 million contract with Voyager Labs in 2018, renewing it for over $1.6 million in 2021, and is still utilizing their services. Voyager Labs claims its tools can analyze online behavior using artificial intelligence to detect and predict crimes. Critics argue that the use of such surveillance tools raises ethical and legal concerns, particularly regarding privacy and the collection of personal information without proper warrants. 

The NYPD's contract allows them to create avatars for data collection, a feature that has drawn backlash from social media companies. While the NYPD stated it uses these tools for public safety and investigative purposes, it has not provided specific details on their application. Additionally, the Queens district attorney has contracted with Cobwebs Technologies for similar surveillance capabilities, though it claims to only use publicly available information. The lack of transparency in these contracts makes it challenging to hold law enforcement accountable for privacy violations. Critics emphasize the need for clearer regulations surrounding the use of such surveillance technologies.

 post=", WIRED") }}

"The Quiet Rise of Real-Time Crime Centers" discusses the increasing establishment of Real-Time Crime Centers (RTCCs) across the United States, which utilize extensive surveillance technologies to monitor urban areas. Originating from concepts like London's Ring of Steel, the first RTCC was created in New York City in 2005, leading to the current existence of 123 RTCCs nationwide. These centers aim to enhance policing efficiency by collecting data from various sources, including CCTV, drones, and social media, often employing facial recognition and predictive policing methods. While proponents argue that RTCCs allow for more targeted policing and reduce crime rates, critics raise concerns about privacy violations and the potential for abuse of surveillance data. The lack of public awareness and oversight enables these centers to operate with minimal scrutiny, leading to fears of mass data collection impacting citizens' rights. Additionally, there are worries about the security of the stored data, especially after incidents of hacking in law enforcement agencies. Critics also highlight the disproportionate focus on policing minority communities and the potential misuse of surveillance in political contexts. Organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation advocate for stricter regulations and community control over surveillance technologies to protect civil liberties. Despite the ongoing debate, the trend towards RTCCs appears to be growing, often without adequate public discourse or legal frameworks to govern their operations.

 blockquote='Early English Christian Bible versions follow the translation of the Septuagint and Latin Vulgate, which interpret azazel as "the goat that departs" (Greek tragos apopompaios, "goat sent out", Latin caper emissarius, "emissary goat"). William Tyndale rendered the Latin as "(e)scape goat" in his 1530 Bible. This translation was followed by subsequent versions up through the King James Version of the Bible in 1611: "And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the Lord, and the other lot for the scapegoat."',

Have you stared at a word and suddenly wondered about its origins? 
This entry from the {{ robustlink(href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/28/upshot/flashback.html", versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20250417020656/https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/28/upshot/flashback.html", versiondate="2025-04-16", title="Flashback: Your Weekly History Quiz,
March 29, 2025 | New York Times", anchor="New York Times Flashback Quiz") }} had me wondering about "scapegoat". 
"scape" — "goat". 
Why do we say that? 
It comes from a phrase in the bible where a goat sent into the wilderness on the Day of Atonement as a symbolic bearer of the sins of the people — Leviticus 16:22, to be exact. 
The translator coined the term from the interpretation of "the goat that departs" and "emissary goat" in that verse.
