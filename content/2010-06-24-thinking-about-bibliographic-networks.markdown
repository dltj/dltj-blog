<p>Ron Murray and Barbara Tillett, both from the Library of Congress, are presenting their research in thinking about bibliographic information as networks of interrelated nodes at ALA Annual.  This is a continuation of <a href="/article/frbr-paper-tool-presentation/">their "paper tool" work</a> which was presented at the Library of Congress last year.</p>
<p>The title of the presentation is <em>From &ldquo;Moby-Dick&rdquo; To &ldquo;Mash-Ups:&rdquo; Thinking About Bibliographic Networks</em>.  The presentation will be Monday, June 28, 2010 at 8:05 a.m. in the Hyatt Regency Washington on Capitol Hill, Yorktown/Valley Forge Rooms.  The presentation is scheduled to go for 75 minutes.<br />

Presentation Summary: Traditional and contemporary attempts to identify and describe simple and complex bibliographic resources have overlooked useful and powerful possibilities, due to the insufficient modeling of &ldquo;bibliographic things of interest.&rdquo; The presentation will introduce a resource description approach that remodels and strengthens FRBR by borrowing key concepts from Information Science and the History of Science. The presentation will reveal portions of a network of bibliographic (and other useful) relationships between printings of Melville&rsquo;s novel dating from 1851-1975 into the present.  In addition, structural similarities between the print publication network and the multimedia &ldquo;mash-ups&rdquo; seen on YouTube and other websites will be demonstrated and discussed.</p>
