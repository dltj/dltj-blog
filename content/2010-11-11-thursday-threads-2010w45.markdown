<p>It has been a long week, so for many of you this edition of <i><acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester">DLTJ</acronym></i> <a href="/category/thursday-threads/">Thursday Threads</a> will actually be read on Friday.  The spirit was willing, the topics were certainly out there in the past seven days, but the necessary distractions were numerous.  Please enjoy this edition whenever you read it.  As always, there is lots more on my <a href="http://friendfeed.com/dltj/" title="Peter Murray - FriendFeed">FriendFeed aggregation page</a>.</p>
<h2>Google Refine 2.0, a power tool for data wranglers</h2>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/" title="google-refine - Project Hosting on Google Code">Google Refine</a> is a power tool for working with messy data sets, including cleaning up inconsistencies, transforming them from one format into another, and extending them with new data from external web services or other databases.  Version 2.0 introduces a new extensions architecture, a reconciliation framework for linking records to other databases (like <a href="http://www.freebase.com/" title="Freebase homepage">Freebase</a>), and a ton of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/wiki/ChangesFor2p0" title="google-refine - Change list for version 2.0">new transformation commands and expressions</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/" title="Google Open Source Blog">Google's Open Source blog</a> has <a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2010/11/announcing-google-refine-20-power-tool.html" title="Announcing Google Refine 2.0, a power tool for data wranglers - Google Open Source Blog">this announcement</a> of a major new release of their "Refine" software package.  It is software that runs on your Windows, Mac, or UNIX machine and you access it with your web browser.  If your first inclination for cleaning up data sets is to drag out Excel or write a script using regular expressions, check out the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNccGtn3Wb0" title="Google Refine 2.0 - Introduction (1 of 3) - Youtube">three</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45EnWK-fE9k" title="Google Refine 2.0 - Data Transformation (2 of 3) - YouTube">demonstration</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tsyz3ibYzk" title="Google Refine 2.0 - Data Augmentation (3 of 3) - YouTube">videos</a> and see if Refine might get you to your end result faster.</p>
<h2>Why Do eBooks Cost So Much? (A Publisher&rsquo;s Perspective)</h2>
<blockquote><p>So far in our experience at Thomas Nelson, the elimination of manufacturing and distribution costs are being offset by retail price reductions and the three additional costs I have outlined. The good news is that we are making about the same margins, regardless of whether we sell the book in physical form or digital. As a result, I don&rsquo;t expect eBook retail prices to come down any more. If they do, then publishers will have to figure out how to make it work. But for right now, I think the pricing is fair, based on the associated costs.</p></blockquote>
<p>This <a href="http://michaelhyatt.com/why-do-ebooks-cost-so-much.html" title="Why Do eBooks Cost So Much? (A Publisher&rsquo;s Perspective)">post</a> comes from the chairman and CEO of Thomas Nelson Publishers.  In it he describes the shifting costs of physical versus digital production from a publisher's perspective. His practical upshot? "I don't expect eBook retail prices to come down any more."</p>
<h2>Principles for Open Bibliographic Data</h2>
<blockquote><p>For some time now the OKFN Working Group on Open Bibliographic Data has been working on Principles on Open Bibliographic Data. While <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120306194521/http://okfnpad.org/openbibliography-principles" title="EtherPad: openbibliography-principles">first attempts</a> were mainly directed towards libraries and other public institutions we decided to broaden the principle&rsquo;s scope by amalgamating it with <a href="http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/open-bibliography/2010-October/000471.html" title="[open-bibliography] Tomorrow: 4th Virtual Meeting">Peter Murray-Rust&rsquo;s draft publisher guidelines</a>. The results can be seen below. We ask anyone to review these principles, discuss the text and suggest improvements.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here are the highlights of the <a href="http://openbiblio.net/2010/10/15/principles-for-open-bibliographic-data/" title="Principles for Open Bibliographic Data | Open Biblio (graphic) Projects">five principles mentioned in the post</a>: when publishing data make an explicit and robust license statement; use a recognized waver or license that is appropriate for metadata; if you want your data to be effectively used and added to by others it should be open as defined by the Open Knowledge/Data Definition; we strongly recommend explicitly placing bibliographic data in the public domain via PDDL or CCo; and we urge creators of bibliographic metadata explicitly either dedicate this to the public domain or use an open license.</p>
<h2>"Copyright Infringement and Me" -- The Sad Tale of Cooks Source</h2>
<blockquote><p>My 2005 Ice Dragon entry, called "A Tale of Two Tarts" was apparently printed without my knowledge or permission in a magazine and I am apparently the victim of copyright infringement.</p></blockquote>
<p>That is the beginning of the beginning of a <a href="http://illadore.livejournal.com/30674.html" title="Copyright Infringement and Me | Illadore's House o Crack">tale</a> of significant copyright infringments by a small advertising-supported publication in western New England.  The details have been <a href="http://www.edrants.com/the-cooks-source-scandal-how-a-magazine-profits-on-theft/" title="The Cooks Source Scandal: How a Magazine Profits on Theft">summarized</a> by others.  What I find useful, though, are the posts that talk about <span class="removed_link" title="http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2010/11/05/cooks-source-what-should-judith-griggs-have-done/">lessons</span> <a href="
<p>UPDATE - 22 November 2010: The saga of Illadore (Monica Gaudio) and Cooks Source Magazine (Judith Griggs) draws to an end, with the closing of Cooks Source Magazine.</p>
