  content: "Hmm, in one sense there's a precedent for this, any other class action
    suit ever.  That's how class action suits work, in the US. (Other countries may
    have quite different legal frameworks for such things). \r\n\r\nBut there is one
    odd thing here. It would be an ordinary class action settlement if it was just
    about _Google_.  You can be in on this settlement with Google, or you can retain
    the right to sue Google independently later if you want.  That's how class action
    suits work. (Although since Google is promising to take down anyone' stuff that
    asks them to, I'm not sure what you'd have to gain from an independent settlement,
    not joining in the class?)\r\n\r\nThe weird thing is the Book Rights Registry.
    Which reminds me, wait, while the Books Rights Registry is being _set up_ as as
    this kind of over-arching precedent setting thing (just look at the name), the
    only _legal_ standing it will have is with Google specifically.  No other displayers-of-digital-text
    have agreed to use it. And even if they do, use of it doesn't automatically grant
    'safe harbor' status to anyone other than Google. it's just part of the settlement
    between Google, and those publisher's who are part of the class. \r\n\r\nOf course,
    we can count on it being used as a precedent, it is intentionally being set up
    as a template, and we can count on the publisher's organizations offering this
    same sort of deal (esp, use of Rights Registry == 'safe harbor') to lots of other
    people. Which is why it maybe SEEMS like such a big thing that how can this judge
    have the power to approve it?  But legally, all he's approving is a settlement
    between Google specifically and the class. \r\n\r\nThere is no _legal_ safe harbor
    provided by the Rights Registry, even if the judge approves it. It is merely a
    settlement between Google and the class who is included in the settlement. \r\n\r\nIt's
    sort of an attempted end-run around congress's failure to modernize actual copyright
    law for the digital world. Which, the copyright-owning-class would honestly rather
    they NOT do, that's a can of worms they don't want to open."

  content: "You're right, of course, Jonathan -- the point of a class action is to
    efficiently extend the judgement to a large group of plaintiffs.  It is the scope
    of the plaintiff class that I find breathtaking.  That's the part I wonder about;
    is there precedence for such a large class to move through the process at what
    seems like internet time (four months)?\r\n\r\nYou also bring up a very good point
    about the extent that the Book Rights Registry extends beyond the settlement with
    Google.  Paragraph 6.2(b) of the Settlement Agreement (page 65) says (with emphasis
    added): <blockquote>The Registry will be organized on a basis that allows the
    Registry, among other things, to (i) represent the interests of Rightsholders
    in connection with this Settlement Agreement, (ii) respond in a timely manner
    to requests by Google, Fully Participating Libraries and Cooperating Libraries,
    and (iii) <strong>to the extent permitted by law, license Rightsholders' U.S.
    copyrights to third parties</strong>.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe Notice of Class
    Action Settlement (the distilled summary of the Settlement Agreement) is even
    more explicit about the possibility that the work of the Registry will extend
    beyond Google.  This quote comes from paragraph 8(B) on page 11 (with emphasis
    added): <blockquote>The Registry will represent the interests of the Rightsholders,
    both in connection with the Settlement <strong>as well as in other commercial
    arrangements, including with companies other than Google</strong> (subject to
    the express approval of the Rightsholders of the Books involved in such other
    commercial arrangements). </blockquote>\r\n\r\nI'm guessing the Registry, once
    it is established under the court's authority for rightsholders as defined in
    the settlement, can act as an agency for the rightsholders to enter into contracts
    with other entities on behalf of the authors/publishers that remain in the class.
    \ As <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/forum/copyright/lessig3.htm\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">Lawrence Lessig points out</a>, some contracts can supersede
    copyright law.  Can the contract between the Registry, on behalf of the authors/publishers,
    and a new digital distribution option provide effectively the same thing as the
    \"safe harbor\" in the Settlement Agreement?\r\n\r\nIf you don't want the Registry
    to act on your behalf in this way, the only way to make sure that doesn't happen
    is to op-out of the class -- even if you like everything else in the agreement.
    \ If you sign up for the class, it would seem that the board of directors of the
    Registry would be able to enter into such agreements on your behalf, and may not
    give the individual rightsholders a way to opt-out of subsequent agreements like
    it has for the Google settlement.\r\n\r\nWhat would be very useful, at least in
    my mind, would be a comparison and contrast with other rightsholder conglomerates
    such as BMI and ASCAP."

  content: "Agreed, except I suspect that the Registry would HAVE to give rights holders
    a way to opt out of any subsequent agreements it makes with non-Google entities.
    \r\n\r\nRemember, this settlement only legally applies to Google. \r\n\r\nThat's
    why the things you highlighted in the agreement about the limitations on the Registry
    acting with parties other than Google: \"to the extent permitted by law, license
    Rightsholders&rsquo; U.S. copyrights to third parties.\"  \"subject to the express
    approval of the Rightsholders of the Books involved in such other commercial arrangements\"\r\n\r\nSo
    being in the class and agreeing to the settlement won't give the Registry the
    legal ability to license to anyone other than Google without your permission.
    \ They won't have the legal authority to do that without an opt-out, and may not
    even have the legal authority to do it on \"opt out\" rather than an \"opt in\"
    basis."

  content: Good point -- if the Registry doesn't give rightsholders a way of opting-out
    of subsequent agreements, the Registry itself is likely to be the defendant in
    a subsequent lawsuit.

  content: 'I am the self-publisher of eight books. I have opted out of the Settlement
    both by filling out the on-line form provided by Google and by sending a certified
    letter to the Settlement Administrator. One interesting point is that they have
    refused to tell me whether any of my works were scanned, saying that they will
    not release that information, " to prevent people from making false claims." This
    is even though I told them I am not making a claim, and even though I provided
    a list of my works with all necessary identifying data. They say if I had agreed
    to the Settlement, _then_, and only then, they''d tell me whether any of my works
    were scanned. Two of my books are appearing in Google Book Search, and I certainly
    did not submit them. Some people believe Google Book Search is identical to the
    list of works scanned but as far as I can tell, Google has never claimed any such
    thing.  End result: I don''t know whether my works were scanned and the Settlement
    people say I have no right to be told.'

In giving preliminary approval, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_E._Sprizzo" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_E._Sprizzo">Judge John E. Sprizzo</a> authorized the publication of the notice of settlement and set a final settlement fairness hearing for June 11, 2009.</p>
<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The judge's decision sets in motion a series of events over the next eight months:</p>
<p><b>January 5, 2009, the <i>Notice Commencement Date</i></b>:  Starting on this date, Class Counsel (the lawyers representing the authors and publishers) will begin sending the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081211213014/http://books.google.com/booksrightsholders/notice.html" title="Google Book Search Copyright Settlement">Notice of Settlement</a> to settlement class members.  On or before <b>January 12, 2009</b>, the Class Counsel will start publishing the settlement's <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081122/http://books.google.com/booksrightsholders/Attachment-J-Summary-Notice-of-Class-Action-Settlement.pdf" title="http://books.google.com/booksrightsholders/Attachment-J-Summary-Notice-of-Class-Action-Settlement.pdf">Summary Notice</a> [PDF] to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081122/http://books.google.com/booksrightsholders/Attachment-K-Paid-Media-Schedule.pdf" title="http://books.google.com/booksrightsholders/Attachment-K-Paid-Media-Schedule.pdf">a wide, varied, and impressive quantity of publications</a> [PDF].  All of this notification must be completed by <b>February 27, 2009</b>.</p>
<p><b>May 5, 2009</b>: The deadline for members of the settlement class (authors and publishers) to op-out of the settlement.  It is also the deadline to declare an objection to the settlement, file a notice of intent to appear at the final settlement hearing, or for members of the class to establish counsel of their own other than the counsel appointed for the class.</p>
<p><b>June 11, 2009 at 1pm, the <i>Final Settlement/Fairness Hearing</i></b>: The hearing will be held in <a href="http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/nGetInfo?jid=2258&amp;cid=999&amp;ctype=na&amp;instate=na" title="U.S. District Court &bull; Southern District of New York">courtroom 14C</a>, <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/" title="U.S. District Court &bull; Southern District of New York">United States District Court for the Southern District of New York</a>, <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/site_manhattan.php" title="U.S. District Court &bull; Southern District of New York">Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse</a>, <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;q=500+Pearl+St.,+New+York,+NY+10007-1312&amp;num=100&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;sll=40.713987,-74.002055&amp;sspn=0.006295,0.006295&amp;ei=3Z8oSefQIpvW2wKL76zfDA&amp;cd=17&amp;cid=40713987,-74002054,9754717278815923944&amp;li=lmd&amp;z=14&amp;t=m" title="Google Maps">500 Pearl Street, New York, NY</a>.  "The purpose of the Hearing shall be to determine: (a) whether the terms and conditions of the proposed Settlement Agreement are fair, reasonable, and adequate; (b) whether to certify the Class and the Sub-Classes for the purposes of the settlement; and (c) whether the proposed Settlement Agreement should be approved by the Court and judgment entered thereon."</p>
<h2>In the Grand Scheme of Things...</h2>
<p>In reading Judge Sprizzo's order granting preliminary settlement approval, I was struck all over again by the scope of what is being undertaken in the settlement.  Paragraph 21 of the order (with emphasis added) is:</p>
<blockquote><p>Members of the Settlement Class and Sub-Classes will be excluded from the settlement only if they comply with the opt-out procedures set forth in the Notice and Settlement Agreement, which procedures are hereby approved as fair and reasonable.  <strong>Unless they have excluded themselves, members of the Settlement Class and Sub-Classes shall be bound by all determinations and judgments in this case relating to the proposed Settlement, whether favorable or unfavorable, including the dismissal of the Action with prejudice</strong> and the release of Google Releasees, Fully Participating Library Releasees, Cooperating Library Releasees, Public Domain Library Releasees and Other Library Releasees from liability to members of the class.  Persons who timely exclude themselves from the Class in accordance with the procedures prescribed in the Notice and Settlement Agreement will not be bound by any orders or judgments entered in the Action to the proposed settlement, and shall not receive any benefits provided in the proposed Settlement Agreement in the event it is approved by the Court.</p></blockquote>
<p>I've often said "I'm not a lawyer, but..." -- then go on to give a non-lawyerly opinion.  This time I'm saying "I'm not a lawyer, and" I don't get how the court has the power to do what it is doing.  The number of people in the settlement class is huge -- all of the authors who have self-published and/or retained copyright to their works and all of the publishers over the last eight decades, not to mention their heirs (since the current incarnation of <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-duration.html" title="U.S. Copyright Office - How Long Does Copyright Protection Last? (FAQ)">copyright law extends the rights 70 years past the death of the author</a>).  It would seem that in the span of four months (January 5th to May 5th), all of these people need to see the notice and make a decision on whether they want to op-out of the settlement.  Tens of thousands (hundreds of thousands?) of people need to decide whether they agree with a sweeping new Books Rights Registry and what will probably become a template of an agreement covering retrospective, had-not-been-conceived digital rights.  </p>
<p>Is there precedence for this?</p>
<p>I first found announcement of the judge's order in a posting at <a href="http://thecite.blogspot.com/2008/11/judge-tentatively-approves-google-book.html" title="The CITE: Judge tentatively approves Google Book Search settlement">The Cite</a>.
