In doing so, OCLC has reaffirmed the existence and applicability of the  "<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090520125245/http://www.oclc.org/support/documentation/worldcat/records/guidelines/default.htm" title="Guidelines for the Use and Transfer of OCLC-Derived Records">Guidelines for the Use and Transfer of OCLC-Derived Records</a>" (the 1987 guidelines) and announced its intention to assemble a new group to draft a policy with "with more input and participation from the OCLC membership."</p>
<p>There will also be an open forum at the ALA Annual conference in Chicago where the Review Board will discuss their findings and answer questions.  The forum is on Sunday, July 12th from 10:30am to noon in the Waldorf room of the Chicago Hilton.  OCLC is offering a <span class="removed_link" title="https://www3.oclc.org/app/ala_registration/">registration form</span> for the event.</p>
