  content: "The SFX link resolver is capable of both a &amp; b. It recognizes the
    service type parameter and is capable of direct linking to to the desired content.
    The SFX knowledge base is, in effect, a \"pathing engine\" that constructs target
    urls by plugging the citation data into a known url structures.\r\n\r\nThe fact
    that you have to initiate the search at the PubGet seems like a definite downside.
    That said, there is still something disruptively appealing about it. Maybe just
    the more familiar search UI patterns.\r\n\r\n(disclaimer: I'm an SFX developer)"

  content: "Thanks, Jay -- I didn't know <em>that</em> about SFX or its knowledge
    base.  I wonder how often it is implemented.  I chatted with OhioLINK's staff
    liaison to our user services committee; Zoe reaffirmed that our public services
    folks definitely want that intermediate screen.  Perhaps for the same reasons
    that EBSCOhost wants that intermediate screen. \r\n\r\nIf I get any spare time
    (hah!) I'm going to try constructing some OpenURL against the leading journal
    publisher/aggregator targets and see if I get back something that resembles full
    text for the \"fulltext\" Service Type."

<p>In June, a new service that speeds access to life sciences literature reached a milestone.  Called <a href="http://pubget.com/search" title="Pubget homepage">PubGet</a>, it is a service that reduces the number of clicks to the full text of an article, and the milestone was <a href="http://pubgetteam.blogspot.com/2009/06/50.html" title="Pubget Team: 50">activating the 50th institution using its service</a>.  Using its own proprietary "pathing engine", it links directly to the full text on the publisher's website.  PubGet does this by understanding the link structure for each journal of each publisher and constructing the link to the full-text based on information from the citation.  The PubGet service <a href="http://pubget.com/site/contact/whats_pubget" title="What's Pubget?">focuses</a> on the life sciences journals indexed in <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/" title="PubMed Home">PubMed</a> -- hence the play on names:  PubMed to PubGet.</p>
<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1205" align="alignright" width="300" caption="Typical View of a PubGet Article Display"]<a href="/assets/images/2009/08/OLINKS-screen-for-Christensen-article.png"><img src="/assets/images/2009/08/OLINKS-screen-for-Christensen-article-300x216.png" alt="OLINKS screen for Christensen article" title="OLINKS screen for Christensen article" width="300" height="216" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1205" /></a>

<p class="wp-caption-text">EBSCOhost screen for Christensen article</p>
<p><a href="/assets/images/2009/08/Nature-The-shale-revolution_1249432025376.png"><img src="/assets/images/2009/08/Nature-The-shale-revolution_1249432025376-300x222.png" alt="Typical View of a PubGet Article Display" title="Typical View of a PubGet Article Display" width="300" height="222" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1207" /></a>[/caption] In a typical interaction, a user would start at a web page with a journal article citation that has a link to the user's OpenURL resolver.  Contained in that link is the citation metadata that identifies the specific article.  Clicking on that link takes you to the OpenURL resolver web page for that specific article.  That web page contains links to any online versions of the article, and might also include links to library catalog records for physical copies, and options to search for similar articles.  An example of one of these pages is <span class="removed_link" title="http://olinks.ohiolink.edu/olinks.php?id=doi:&amp;genre=article&amp;isbn=&amp;issn=00178012&amp;title=Harvard+Business+Review&amp;volume=84&amp;issue=12&amp;date=20061201&amp;aulast=Christensen%2c+Clayton+M.&amp;atitle=Disruptive+Innovation+for+Social+Change.&amp;spage=94&amp;pages=94-101">this one from my place of work for an article by Clayton Christensen in the Harvard Business Review</span>.  (When you are coming from an OhioLINK member institution, it looks like the screen image to the right.)  Clicking on that link that says "<a href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&site=ehost-live&scope=site&db=bth&AN=23081431" title="EBSCOhost page for Christensen article">Full text of this article at EBSCO</a>" takes you to yet another page -- this time from EBSCOhost -- that has the citation data again and the options for viewing or taking other actions on the article.  Once there it is one more click to the HTML or PDF full text of the article.  From the perspective of the creators of PubGet, that is two clicks and two screens too many.  PubGet's pathing engine knows about the structure of links on the publishers website, and so it creates a link directly from the citation in the search results list to the article PDF.</p>
<p>The pathing engine is one of three components that make up the service.  The other two are a search engine and a personalization feature.  The search engine indexes the citation and abstract fields; it is not nearly as sophisticated as the thesauri-driven search engine native to PubMed, but it does the job for cases when you have a known citation.  The personalization feature allows you to tie your account on PubGet to an institution, and with that knowledge the PubGet service can know exactly what digital rights your institution has for each journal and can create links to the full-text article that go through your institution's proxy server.  The account system also enables you to have new articles matching your search criteria sent to you and to mark articles in the search results for later bulk downloading (via a <a href="http://ianconnor.blogspot.com/2009/03/download-all-papers-from-firefox-within.html" title="Download all papers from Firefox within Pubget">Firefox plugin</a>). ((Since the articles are not held within the PubGet service itself, the bulk article downloading function requires a Firefox plugin so that the article requests come from your browser to the publisher's site.))</p>
<h2>Thinking About PubGet in a Wider Information Ecosystem</h2>
<p>One quandary I have with PubGet is that it bypasses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenURL" title="OpenURL - Wikipedia">OpenURL</a> as the open standard for linking to full-text content.  In order to take advantage of PubGet's unique characteristic -- the pathing engine to get straight to the article text -- you need to start at the PubGet site itself in order to get the direct URLs to the articles.  This is a pretty significant downside to the service.  You can't get the pathing engine along with the powerful PubMed search engine.</p>
<p>It would be nice if PubGet could be set up as an OpenURL target, and when it receives a request translates it to the direct link to the full-text using its pathing engine.  That way I could set up PubGet as the OpenURL resolver in my PubMed account, and the article links in PubMed would automatically go to the full text.  I don't know how this would work as a business model for PubGet, though, because as an OpenURL resolver is this manner, it makes the PubGet website invisible -- through a series of browser redirects I'd go from PubMed to PubGet to the publisher site.  (If the point is to <a href="http://pubget.com/site/contact/how_we_make_money" title="Pubget: How We Make Money">make money selling advertising for related industries</a>, a configuration that completely by-passes any visible signs of PubGet would cut into that revenue source.)</p>
<p>As I was sharing background on PubGet with Thomas Dowling, a colleague at OhioLINK, he pointed out something I didn't know about OpenURL:  it is within the standard to specify a "service type" in the OpenURL Context Object.  Section 5.1 of the <a href="http://www.niso.org/kst/reports/standards?step=2&amp;gid=&amp;project_key=d5320409c5160be4697dc046613f71b9a773cd9e" title="ANSI/NISO Z39.88 - The OpenURL Framework for Context-Sensitive Services">NISO standard for OpenURL</a> says a service type is "The resource that defines the type of service (pertaining to the Referent) that is requested."  And there are indeed <a href="http://alcme.oclc.org/openurl/servlet/OAIHandler?verb=GetRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=oai_dc&amp;identifier=info:ofi/fmt:xml:xsd:sch_svc" title="XML Metadata Format for Scholarly ServiceTypes">service types registered</a> as part of the SAP2 Community Profile: abstract, citation, fulltext, holdings, ill, and any.  So the recipient of an OpenURL request, using the "fulltext" Service Type, should be able to replicate the proprietary PubGet pathing engine using a standard OpenURL structure.  In a brief bit of experimentation, though, I was not able to find an OpenURL resolver that a) knew how to handle a Service Type parameter, and/or b) knew how to honor that parameter by getting directly to the full text.  As OpenURL undergoes its 5-year review this year, it might be worthwhile to emphasize this part of the standard with examples and descriptions of best practices so it is more widely adopted.</p>
