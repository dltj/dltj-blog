  content: I can understand the value of compartmentalizing this effort into a corporation,
    and adding layers between the process and Stanford.   I hope that the 'angel'
    in question isn't looking for a 10%+ return on investment.

  content: 'dreamking:  Could you write a bit more on the benefits of compartmentalizing
    this effort?  I don''t quite see it; in fact it would seem to complicate Stanford''s
    effort to bring the same techniques/technology to other distance classes.  (If
    they do indeed want to engage in such an effort.)  I can see how spinning it off
    early would possibly aid in adoption by other schools, but then there is your
    final sentence and a question I should have added to my list:  what is the angel
    investor hoping to get out of its investment?'

  content: "I guess I start from the position that Stanford won't gain from this mechanism
    until it has a proven track record.  Even then, the branding must will be kept
    distinct - Stanford, like any other prestigious academic institution, has a vested
    interest in retaining the cachet of their degree-granting service.  Any potential
    liability stemming from this unique idea would be contained behind the corporate
    firewall and, like you also note, make it easier for a consortium of universities
    and colleges to work under an umbrella to offer a whole suite of credit-earning
    courses.   \r\n\r\nmy comment about the angel investor is that, while it may make
    sense for this to be a corporation, it probably won't work out (or worse, ruin
    the idea) if they're a strictly for-profit venture.  If that were the case, University
    of Phoenix, Kaplan University and others would be affordable successes.    I like
    SUNY - Empire State College.  They're not quite trying to deliver on a $10,000
    degree, but it's certainly possible through them.  CLEP exams also get short shrift,
    and I think they're a good platform for making college affordable.   It should
    be revisited and reformed if necessary, but the premise is sound - at least for
    100 level courses.  A $30 book, and an $80 test = 3-6 college credits, accepted
    by hundred of universities?  Win.  We need to figure out how to make at least
    the first 45 college credits affordable.  Luckily, the work is half-done.  It
    just needs a national scope and a champion.  I can envision a CLEP self-study
    platform, supported by Khan Academy streaming content, followed up with an open-source
    platform for at least 200-level courses.  Independent study or small classes for
    300- and 400-level would make college much more cost-effective.   \r\n\r\nIn the
    long run, I don't see the Ivys expending a lot of capital to make this happen,
    which is a shame.  Diluting their brand in the eyes of their alumni donors is
    not going to be high on their agenda."

  content: "i think the core IP behind the class is the ability to take student feedback,
    quiz answers on the fly. For e.g. the professor hand writes a question on the
    white board and puts forward a few questions. The students will be able to click
    on the video in the right places to register their answer and the system can keep
    a track of where everyone clicks. \r\nIn my mind, this is truly great and probably
    the core technology behind the online classroom."

  content: A possible profit model is via the textbook sales.  If all 130k class registrants
    bought one at $100, that is not a bad return for the authors and publisher at
    least.  I don't think they are likely to realize the full $13 million potential,
    but even 10% of that would be a nice start for one class.

    @dreamking:  Thanks for expanding on your ideas.  The risk of Stanford diluting its brand is an interesting one, but in that case I would expect Know Labs to have a more prominent stage than an icon at the bottom of the registration screen.  I wouldn't have really thought this was anything but Stanford's effort if I had not read the terms-of-service.  I would also guess that this got a lot more traction than they thought (a couple hundred thousand people expressed interest) and so they might be making this up as they go along.

    The comment about the angel investor is right on target.  If there were huge amounts of money to be made here (beyond, arguably, the money made by the for-profit companies that was subsidized by federal grants and loans over the past half-dozen years) the for-profit companies would certainly have the motivation to innovate in this area.  There is a lot of good that can be done in reducing the friction it takes for students to grasp the fundamentals taught in 100-level courses, and doing that much can save money for students and institutions that go on to the higher level courses.

    I think part of why this class was so interesting, though, is that Stanford is lending its name (and consequently the expected high caliber of the instructors and rigor of the coursework) to this effort.  It will be interesting to see how the certificate of completion is branded -- will it have any mention of Stanford at all?

    alone (which, from my point of view, is an added benefit of learning what new
    is happening and coming in robotics and artificial intelligence in the next few
    years).'

    policy didn''t strike me as out of the ordinary (particularly banning the practice
    of being put in a <frameset> on other sites), and I don''t think that part ''c''
    ("not to use any high volume, automated, or electronic means") prohibits client-side
    scripting like Greasemonkey.  It does mean that you can''t scrape the site, which
    would admittedly be nice to do <em>if it were permissible</em> to add the content

    Launch? Beatrice K. Otto, Disruptive Library Technology Jester, September 11,
    2011. Via George Siemens comes this link to an in-depth examination of the Stanford
    AI open course. In a nutshell: what if this isn&#039;t actually an open course,
    but rather nothing more than a beta test for some new software by a company called
    KnowLabs. Seb Schmoller wonders whether Know Labs was already involved (or even
    there?) when the AI course was originally advertised. See also this Slashdot discussion.
    Of course there&#039;s nothing wrong with using an open course to test some software.
    But it would be a shame if the &#039;open&#039; phase of this experiment is limited
    to just the courses being offered this session. The startups are circling education,
    writes Siemens, calling for transparency in the offering of these courses. I&#039;m
    afraid he will be disappointed. (Hits Today: 5 Total: 480) [Direct Link] [Tags:

  content: "I'm both in the AI course and the machine learning course.\r\n\r\nHonestly,
    if this is a prototype for a future commercial venture, I am disappointed with
    the quality of the presentation, as I feel that the ML course is significantly
    better presented, along with actual programming assignments.\r\nThe AI course,
    while contents-wise good, is basically a screen-cast of poor handwriting on a
    board, with multiple choice and numeric assignments only. I do prefer the frequent
    questions to the fairly sparse ones in the ML course, but the ML course presentation
    of concepts is easy to follow and refer back to, and the homework assignments
    guide the user through the issues. The actual quizes/homeworks for both courses
    are surprisingly easy."

  content: The mass introduction of [certain] frontiers of thought has the potential
    to contribute to research. I am thinking of research activity which is young enough
    to be working with conceptual models that an average [bright, basically educated]
    person can understand, and extend. Even if this "average person" is 1 in 10000,
    the audience response could keep a small army of graduate assistants busy. The
    conceptual foundation constructed in one semester could be adequate to support
    the seeds and eventual germination of important contributions.

  content: "Stanford consciousness course will start as scheduled on Feb 7 2012\r\n\r\n(So
    sorry if this is off-topic!)\r\n\r\nThere is an outline and sample lectures at\r\n\r\nhttp://floyddogdesign.com/sean/newsyll2010.html\r\n\r\nPlease
    just follow the blog at\r\n\r\nhttp://consciousnesstalk.blogspot.com/\r\n\r\nif
    you want to register\r\n\r\nI will then supply passwords etc\r\n\r\nPlease note;\r\n\r\n
    \   While this course is being taught precisely as at Stanford, it will not give
    Stanford credits\r\n\r\n    Unlike the current batch of courses, it is NOT being
    delayed\r\n\r\nTo repeat;\r\n\r\nIt does NOT use video, as we believe that slides
    + voiceover is a more economical means of learning. The method of assessment is
    essay submission at the end of the course. As with all the other courses recently
    offered following the AI model, it is NOT accredited by Stanford, but taught exactly
    as in Stanford\r\n\r\nThe detailed syllabus follows;\r\n\r\nCourse description\r\n\r\n
    Subject area Cognitive:  science\r\n\r\n Position within subject area: Neuroscience
    and philosophy of mind\r\n\r\n Intended audience\r\n\r\n College students; intelligent
    and interested laypeople\r\n\r\n Course objectives\r\n\r\nWhen students have Completed
    this course, they will:\r\n\r\n -know the essentials of neuroscience, including
    the perhaps more veridical theories of neural function and communication that
    may currently be emerging from such areas as non- linear systems, quantum mechanics,
    and analysis of subthreshold neural oscillations\r\n\r\n - know the basic arguments
    in the philosophy of mind from Plato through Descartes, Berkeley, Hume, Kant,
    Levine and such popular putative contributions as that of Chalmers.\r\n\r\n -
    In the absence of any certain conclusions about the nature of subjective experience
    , which this course dues not claim to give, be able to evaluate the many current
    and future claims that will be presented to them proposing a direct link from
    neural fact to subjective experience\r\n\r\n Prerequisites for students\r\n\r\n
    Interest in the area; commitment to engage with others in dialogue\r\n\r\n Session
    by Session\r\n\r\n Week 1: Historical aspects: Plato, Aquinas, Descartes, Locke,
    Berkeley, Hume, Kant, Husserl, Levine; the advent of cognitive science.  Neurophysiological
    plausibility: assessment of conventional neural networks, the integrate and fire
    paradigm, and approaches built on subthreshold resonance. Introduction of the
    resonate and fire (RFNN)paradigm; vocabulary of non-linear systems to be used
    in the course. The Hilbert transform as superset of the Fourier transform; its
    applicability to brain function. Criteria for consequences for phenomenal experience.\r\n\r\n
    Week 2: RFNs continued. The encompassing context; how does this work relate to
    contemporary controversies exemplified by the Noe/Hurley/Block debate, and the
    notion of a neural correlate of conscious experience.\r\n\r\n Week 3:   Continuation
    of analysis of the work of RNF theorists like Izhekevich, Reinker and Doris. The
    interaction of spatial and temporal codes. Topographic maps that go point-to-point
    into higher-level maps and retinotopic mapping  from the retina to LGN, from there
    to V1, and in the other \"V areas\" up to IT.  How do these spatial maps interact
    with spectral codes of Karl Pribram?\r\n\r\n Week 4: Multimodal mapping. Spatial
    location and information integration. What other binding mechanisms are there,
    for example in Martin's LIMSI work? ;Filling ; mechanisms and change blindness.\r\n\r\n
    Week 5  The contrastive approach in consciousness studies. Axonal versus dendritic
    communication. The FM radio analogy pioneered by Izhekevich, Doris  and Freeman.
    Meaning as AM  in the work of Freeman\r\n\r\n Week 6:  Other theories of consciousness;
    conscious inessentialism in Lashley and Jackendoff. Fodor versus Descartes on
    modularity. Freeman, Suppes; consciousness as a sample.\r\n\r\n Week 7:   Edelman,
    involving the dynamic core hypothesis. Llinas and the thalamocortical system.
    Pellionisz and Llinas on tensors in the work popularized by Churchland\r\n\r\n
    Week 8: Recapitualtion of historical aspects and summary.. What theory, if any,
    will prevail? What seem to be the relevant criteria?\r\n\r\n Weeks 9 and 10 Student
    presentations.\r\n\r\n Methods of Instruction While the instructor will prepare
    a detailed presentation for each topic, the students will be encouraged to debate
    the topics vigorously throughthe internet , and work together to give presentations\r\n\r\n

The initial news articles made it sound like another example of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources" data-versiondate="2011-09-05" title="Open educational resources | Wikipedia">open educational resources</a> -- a movement popularized by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to put course materials and recordings of lectures online for anyone to use. But with registration for the class open and more details posted on the class homepage, I'm not so sure.<br />

  To start with, here is a sampling of articles describing the class:</p>

  <p>The course is an experiment in an idea called <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Open-Teaching-When-the/124170" data-versiondate="2011-09-05" title="'Open Teaching': When the World Is Welcome in the Online Classroom | Chronicle of Higher Education">massive open online courses,</a> where anyone with an Internet connection can take classes without paying tuition. The professors are recommending that students buy the class textbook, which is co-written by Mr. Norvig, and dedicate at least 10 hours a week to the course, which Stanford considers an intermediate-level class that requires some mathematical and programming knowledge.

<blockquote>
  <p>Dr. Widom [chair of the computer science department] said that having Stanford courses freely available could both assist and compete with other colleges and universities. A small college might not have the faculty members to offer a particular course, but could supplement its offerings with the Stanford lectures.</p>
  <p>There has also been some discussion at Stanford about whether making the courses freely available would prove to be a threat to the university, which charges high fees for tuition. Dr. Thrun [professor and instructor of the AI class] dismissed that idea.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m much more interested in bringing Stanford to the world,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I see the developing world having colossal educational needs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Curious about the class (to brush up on my AI undergraduate class two decades ago and to experience how Stanford could conduct an online class with so many people), I was one of the several tens of thousands that signed up for more information. On Friday evening I got an e-mail with a link to <a href="https://www.ai-class.com/registration/" data-versiondate="2011-09-05">register for the class</a>. I'm also one of those people that sometimes actually reads the terms of service before agreeing to them. That is where I found this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>KnowLabs, Inc. (collectively, "we," "us" or the "Company") has developed the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course website (registration available at the entry-point URL http://www.ai-class.com) (the "Class Site") and the accompanying videos, course materials, exams, homework assignments, forums and other related documents and services related to the class (collectively with the Class Site, the "Online Course") that is available subject to the terms and conditions described in this document and any other guidelines, rules or licenses posted in connection with the Online Course, including the general Terms and Conditions of Use. These Beta Terms and Conditions of Use ("Beta Terms of Use") apply to the first class offered on the Class Site, or any website maintained by the Company which is designated as a "Beta" area.</p>
  <p>We will provide you with, and you desire to receive, the first publicly available access to the Online Course on a non-commercial basis (i.e., "beta" access) to assist us in developing and evaluating the Online Course prior any commercial release of the Course ("Initial Course Offering"); provided, however, that your participation in the Initial Course Offering and/or use of the Online Course is subject to your compliance with the Beta Terms of Use set forth herein and the general Terms and Conditions of Use (collectively the "TOS"). Your continued participation in the Initial Course Offering and/or use of the Online Course evidences your agreement to be bound by the TOS and constitutes a legally binding contract between you and the Company.

</blockquote>
<p>Now this sounds more like an internet startup than a university experimenting with a new form of course delivery. In fact, if you go back to the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/16/science/16stanford.html?_r=1" data-versiondate="2011-09-05" title="Virtual and Artificial, but 58,000 Want Course | NYTimes.com">New York Times article</a>, you learn a little more about KnowLabs: "Part of the instructional software was developed by Know Labs, a company Dr. Thrun [professor and instructor of the AI class] helped start." Know Labs is not listed on the home page of the course, but it is listed on the registration page.</p>
<p>There isn't much to be found about <a href="http://www.knowlabs.com/" data-versiondate="2011-09-05" title="Know Labs - Educating the 21st century.">KnowLabs</a>. The <a href="http://whois.domaintools.com/knowlabs.com" title="Whois information for knowlabs.com from DomainTools">domain was registered to Sebastian Thurun on May 20th</a>. A Google search for KnowLabs brings up:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a blog post by Seb Schmoller in the U.K. <a href="http://fm.schmoller.net/2011/09/know-labs-looking-to-change-the-future-of-education-by-making-it-more-accessible-and-less-expensive.html" data-versiondate="2011-09-05" title="Fortnightly Mailing: Know Labs - looking to &023;change the future of education by making it more accessible and less expensive&023;">that wonders about the role of Know Labs</a>.</li>
  <li>a blog post by George Siemens that <a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2011/09/03/the-startups-are-circling-education/" data-versiondate="2011-09-05" title="The startups are circling education | elearnspace">wonders how the course will be taught</a>.</li>
  <li>a website called <span class="removed_link" title="http://mangrin.org/">mangrin.org</span> that contains the same splash page as the KnowLabs site.</li>
  <li>the LinkedIn profile of <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/davidstavens" title="David Stavens | LinkedIn">David Stavens</a>, Co-Founder, CEO at Know Labs. Know Labs is described on his profile as an "angel funded startup to re-envision and revolutionize education using the social web and mobile apps. We launched www.ai-class.com and attracted over 130,000 students in 190+ countries." He was a research assistant working as a member of Prof. Sebastian Thrun&rsquo;s research lab.</li>
</ul>
<p>So here are my questions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.ai-class.com/registration/tos" data-versiondate="2011-09-05">Terms of Service</a> make no mention of Stanford University and the <span class="removed_link" title="https://www.ai-class.com/registration/faq">Frequently Asked Questions</span> make no mention of Know Labs. What agreement exists between Stanford and Know Labs? Who owns the intellectual property created for this class?</li>
  <li>What material (lecture notes, videos, etc), if any, will be openly available after the course?</li>
  <li>Are there statements anywhere that distance this experiment from the open educational resources movement? There seems to be confusion in the press that the Stanford AI class is some form of OER, so clarity here would be welcome.</li>
  <li>Are the <a href="http://www.db-class.com:80/" data-versiondate="2011-09-05" title="Introduction to Databases - Stanford University">Introduction to Databases</a> class and the <a href="http://www.ml-class.com/" data-versiondate="2011-09-05" title="Machine Learning - Stanford University">Machine Learning</a> class experiments going to use the same platform with Know Labs with the same conditions?
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Mind you, I see nothing disagreeable with the terms of service, and still completed the course registration. I just wish there was a little bit more transparency in the relationship between Stanford, the instructors, and Know Labs.</p>
