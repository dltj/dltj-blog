<p>David Lowe, Preservation Librarian at the University of Connecticut, is coordinating a survey of JPEG2000 use for digital imagery.  The survey asks questions about the use of the JPEG2000 file format (for archival purposes or for access systems), tools used (both JPEG2000 toolkits and software that embeds JPEG2000 toolkits), and considerations of mathematically lossless versus visually lossless compression settings.</p>
<p>This is his announcement:<br />
<blockquote>    I am writing to solicit your help with a survey of library-related digital project staff regarding the implementation of the JPEG 2000 standard for digital images (specifically still images and not motion). We estimate that this task will take approximately 15 minutes of your time. It is available now at: <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=WXFAJwyRNZZilRWzrnum_2fw_3d_3d" title="JPEG2000 Survey">http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=WXFAJwyRNZZilRWzrnum_2fw_3d_3d</a></p>
<p>The survey will remain active until October 31, 2008. Afterward, we will post the results via a report uploaded to our institutional repository, <a href="http://digitalcommons.uconn.edu/" title="DigitalCommons@UConn">digitalcommons.uconn.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Please note that in our report, personal information from the survey will not be revealed, and any comments used will remain unattributed unless the respondent prefers to be credited and indicates that desire in a separate email to me directly at david.lowe@uconn.edu.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help,</p>
<p>David Lowe<br />Preservation Librarian<br />UConn Libraries</p></blockquote>
<p>I encourage you to take the survey as well.</p>
