<p>In 2005 I started reading about Clayton Christensen's theory of Disruptive Technology and became interested in how it
  explains events shaping academic libraries (and other types of libraries, for that matter) and higher education in
  general. This page offers a running bibliography of works by Christensen and others focused on this topic.</p>
<p>If you're just starting in this area, I'd recommend first reading Lafferty's and Lewis' work as they both explore the
  underlying premise of the theories from an academia or academic library mindset. (To dive right in, you may want to
  start with the 2-hour audio book version of Christensen's first work. That is how I started and I found it to be a
  remarkably gentle yet powerful introduction to his concepts.)</p>
<p>If you find anything else along these lines, please let me know -- I'd like to keep growing this bibliography. Also
  note that a more comprehensive list can be found in a <a
