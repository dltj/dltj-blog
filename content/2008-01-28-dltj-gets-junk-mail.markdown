    I would be curious as to how long it takes to get your first DLTJ
    pre-approved credit card offer.

In a related matter, I got my first example today of someone scraping <acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester"><i>DLTJ</i></acronym> to send me junk mail through the U.S. postal service.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/us-mail-spam.jpg" alt="Junk Mail to DLTJ&rsquo;s President, Tom Wilson [?]" /></p>
<p>Now there are several weird things about this.  First, <a href="http://www.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&amp;oe=UTF-8%2F&amp;q=2455+North+Star+Rd,+Columbus,+OH&amp;num=100&amp;ll=40.00819,-83.047811&amp;spn=0.001824,0.00397&amp;t=h&amp;z=18&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;om=0" title="Google Maps">the address is indeed my place of work</a>, but <acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester"><i>DLTJ</i></acronym> is not an OhioLINK communication channel.  (In other words, "the views expressed here are those of the author and not the author's employer...yadda, yadda, yadda.")  The only place the address appears, that I know about, is on <a href="/about/">my contact page on <acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester"><i>DLTJ</i></acronym></a>.  And if one should happen to go to that page to scrape the address, one would see that this blog is written by a guy named Peter Murray, not someone named Tom Wilson.  I can only guess that the Tom Wilson in question is <a href="http://www.tcwhq.com/about.shtml" title="About Tom Wilson">the one that is the Associate Dean for Library Technology at the University of Alabama Libraries</a> and <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.lita.org/ala/lita/aboutlita/org/litagov/2004ACLITAbdmins.cfm">former LITA president</span>, but if not that Tom Wilson has <a href="http://www.tcwhq.com/id_mgmt.shtml" title="Which Tom Wilson?">a list of other Tom Wilson</a>s it might be.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see if name/address combination gets sold to someone else; I'll certainly know by the characteristics of the junk mail received.  I guess I'll also have to expand the disclaimer to say: "the views expressed here are those of the author and not the author's employer or of Tom Wilson...."</p>
