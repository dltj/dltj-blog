  content: Which is lovely, but DPubS is still vaporware, and so I'm not even going
    to believe their DSpace integration claims (which they've been making for ages)
    until I see some non-vapor code.

    -- it always does have to come back to \"show me the code\" -- no, \"SHOW ME THE
    CODE!\" -- right?  Still, it is possible to envision a FEDORA integration before
    a dSpace integration given the nature of those two systems.  Or perhaps that is
    just my FEDORA-bias showing through.\r\n\r\nIn any case, we could know in a few
    months if the open source released version comes to pass..."

  content: Yes, DSpace is a sticky wicket. I'm hoping that the interoperability work
    (e.g. the ACLS report) will kick some of the problems to the front burner. Me,
    I *really want* something to do what DPubS is promising, which is why I'm so annoyed
    at the delay.

<p>The August 2006 edition of "The DPubS Report" produced by Cornell University Libraries for the DPubS community announced work underway at the Penn State to bridge the worlds of <span class="removed_link" title="http://dpubs.org/">DPubS</span> and <a href="http://www.fedora.info/" title="Fedora">FEDORA</a>.  Here is the line from the newsletter:</p>
<pre>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT UPDATE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
[...]
NEAR-TERM SCHEDULED WORK
[...]
* Penn State is working on Fedora interoperability. The plan is to
have that capability in the September release, with a working version
for testing in late August.
</pre>
<p>The newsletter goes on to say that the work will be made available under an open source license, so I for one can't wait to see what it looks like and how we might apply it to our own needs.</p>
