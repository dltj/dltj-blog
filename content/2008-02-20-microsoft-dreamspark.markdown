<p>Stu Hicks, one of OhioLINK's systems engineers, told the OhioLINK staff last night about a <a href="http://channel8.msdn.com/Posts/2047/" title="Bill Gates talks about Free Software, Students, and Technology">new program at Microsoft</a> called <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080922223158/https://downloads.channel8.msdn.com/" title="Microsoft DreamSpark">DreamSpark</a>.  Through this program, post-secondary students around the world who are attending accredited schools or universities can download <span class="removed_link" title="https://downloads.channel8.msdn.com/Products.aspx">some of Microsoft's big developer and designer tools</span> free of charge.  At the time and place this post is being written, the list of software is:</p>
<ul type="square">
<li>Visual Studio 2008 Professional Edition</li>
<li>Windows Server 2003 Standard Edition</li>
<li>SQL Server 2005 Developers Edition</li>
<li>Expression Studio</li>
<li>XNA Game Studio</li>
<li>Visual Studio 2005 Professional Edition</li>
<li>Visual C# 2005 Express Edition</li>
<li>Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition</li>
<li>Visual Basic 2005 Express Edition</li>
<li>SQL Server 2005 Express Edition</li>
<li>Visual Web Developer 2005 Express Edition</li>
<li>Visual J# 2005 Express Edition</li>
<li>Virtual PC 2007</li>
</ul>
<p>Eligibility is determined by either <span class="removed_link" title="https://downloads.channel8.msdn.com/FAQ/UniversityAdministrators.aspx#How%20can%20I%20share%20my%20database...">a Shibboleth or a Windows CardSpace identity provider</span> on the student's campus.  One must <span class="removed_link" title="https://downloads.channel8.msdn.com/FAQ/Students.aspx#how%20will%20i%20know%20if%20i%20am%20signed%20in">link a Windows Live ID account with that campus identity provider</span> and <span class="removed_link" title="https://downloads.channel8.msdn.com/FAQ/Students.aspx#why%20wasnt%20i%20directed">renew that eligibility about once every 12 months</span>. They are using Shibboleth for what it was designed for; it is actually nice to see  <span class="removed_link" title="https://downloads.channel8.msdn.com/FAQ/UniversityAdministrators.aspx#Now%20that%20I%20have%20become%20an%20IDP...">Microsoft recognize that only a true/false response from the campus is required</span> to determine eligibility and that no personally-identifying attributes are passed from the campus to the Microsoft server to make this happen.  There are FAQs for <span class="removed_link" title="https://downloads.channel8.msdn.com/FAQ/Students.aspx">students</span> and for <span class="removed_link" title="https://downloads.channel8.msdn.com/FAQ/UniversityAdministrators.aspx">higher education administrators</span>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://channel8.msdn.com/Posts/2047/" title="Bill Gates talks about Free Software, Students, and Technology">blog post announcing the program</a> has an video interview with Bill Gates, but unfortunately one needs <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/" title="Microsoft Silverlight technology homepage">Microsoft's Flash alternative called Silverlight</a> to watch it.</p>
