<p>Ah, it is the beginning of September when thoughts turn to going back to school, the days turn a little colder (in the northern hemisphere) and the smell of lawsuit briefs is in the air.  Well, okay -- the latter might not be what you expect, but this is a special September, after all.  <a href="/article/gbs-news/" title="Intervention by IA Denied; Deadline for Objections Extended | DLTJ">Postponed from May</a>, the deadline for filing comments in the Google Book Search settlement is coming up.  And everyone is weighing in ("again" for some) on the details of the settlement.  A couple of highlights.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.districtdispatch.org/2009/09/library-associations-submit-supplemental-filing-call-for-increased-oversight-of-google-agreement/" title="Library associations submit supplemental filing, call for increased oversight of Google agreement">American Library Association (ALA), the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) and the Association of Research Libraries (ARL)</a> again offered its support for the settlement, if only the court would promise to extend vigorous oversight of pricing and privacy practices of Google and the Books Rights Registry.  This came in the form of a <a href="http://wo.ala.org/gbs/ala-acrl-arl-brief-to-court/" title="ALA-ACRL-ARL supplemental brief">supplemental filing</a> to the <a href="http://wo.ala.org/gbs/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/googlebrieffinal.pdf" title="ALA-ACRL-ARL original brief">brief</a> the <a href="/article/gbs-libraries-brief/" title=Library Associations File Amicus Brief for Google Book Search Settlement">three organizations filed in May</a> (just prior to the first comment deadline).</p>
<p>{{ image(
    div_float="right",
    width="300",
    caption="Google Search for Open Book Alliance",
    alt="Google Search for Open Book Alliance",
    localsrc="2009/09/Google-Search-for-Open-Book-Alliance-300x222.png",
    localhref="/assets/images/2009/09/Google-Search-for-Open-Book-Alliance.png") }}
An odd group of bedfellows has also <a href="http://www.openbookalliance.org/2009/08/opening-the-book/" title="'Opening the Book' posting">gotten together</a> to oppose the settlement.  Called the "<a href="http://www.openbookalliance.org/" title="Open Book Alliance homepage" rel="homepage">Open Book Alliance</a>", it is made up of (at the moment):  <a href="http://amazon.com/" rel="homepage" title="Amazon homepage">Amazon</a>, the <a href="http://asja.org/" rel="homepage" title="American Society of Journalists and Authors homepage">American Society of Journalists and Authors</a>, the <a href="http://clmp.org/" rel="homepage" title="Council of Literary Magazines and Presses homepage">Council of Literary Magazines and Presses</a>, the <a href="http://archive.org/" rel="homepage" title="Internet Archive homepage">Internet Archive</a>, <a href="http://microsoft.com/" rel="homepage" title="Microsoft homepage">Microsoft</a>, the <a href="http://nyla.org/" rel="homepage" title="New York Library Association homepage">New York Library Association</a>, the <a href="http://spdbooks.org/" rel="homepage" title="Small Press Distribution homepage">Small Press Distribution</a>, the <a href="http://www.sla.org/" rel="homepage" title="Special Libraries Association homepage">Special Libraries Association</a>, and <a href="http://yahoo.com/" rel="homepage" title="Yahoo! homepage">Yahoo!</a>.  Sound vaguely familiar?  That's understandable; if you match up the interested parties of the OBA with the OCA (the <a href="http://www.opencontentalliance.org/" title="Open Content Alliance homepage" rel="homepage">Open Content Alliance</a>), you'll find Microsoft, the Internet Archive, and Yahoo in common.  A search for "Open Book Alliance" in Google, in fact, still brings up the "Open Content Alliance" as the top hit.  The biggest new party, Amazon, to the formation of this group (or reconstitution, if you will) is undoubtedly the inspiration behind a press release from the Authors Guild (a party in the settlement agreement) with a biting title:  <a href="http://authorsguild.org/advocacy/articles/amazon-accuses-someone-else-of-monopolizing.html" title="The Authors Guild - Amazon Accuses Someone Else of Monopolizing Bookselling">Amazon Accuses Someone Else of Monopolizing Bookselling</a>.</p>
<p>Lest you think the fun be over too soon, the deadline for filing briefs has been <a href="http://thepublicindex.org/docs/case_order/20090902.pdf" title="Judge Chin's order extending the deadline for filing briefs">extended</a> yet again from close of business tomorrow (Friday, September 4th, 2009) until 10:00am Tuesday.  Apparently, the court's electronic filing system will be unavailable from 2pm today until 8am on Tuesday the 8th.  The main <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130314184923/http://www.googlebooksettlement.com/" title="Google Book Search Settlement" rel="homepage">settlement website</a> says explicitly that the deadline for rights holders to opt out of the settlement remains September 4th.</p>
<p>But seriously, if you are looking for thoughtful commentary on the commentary, I recommend James Grimmelmann's blog, <a href="http://laboratorium.net/" title="http://laboratorium.net/">The Laboratorium</a>.  Although there isn't a single page that brings together all of his postings about the Google Book Search settlement, he helpfully prepends "GBS:" to the title of all such postings.  If you are looking to <em>participate</em> in the discussion surrounding the settlement, the best place I know of is the <a href="http://thepublicindex.org/settlement" title="The Public Index's version of the settlement statement">interactive version of the settlement notice</a> hosted at The Public Index.  There you can comment and watch the comments of others on a section-by-section basis, along with a <span class="removed_link" title="http://thepublicindex.org/documents">catalog of documents and links</span> from others regarding the settlement.</p>
<p>The next big event after the filing deadline is the Final Fairness Hearing, scheduled for 10am on October 7, 2009 (or, at least, scheduled for that day and time at the moment).  At the fairness hearing, we get to hear from the the court as it considers whether to grant final approval of the Settlement.  Somehow, though, I don't think even that will be close to the final word on the settlement.  Stay tuned...
