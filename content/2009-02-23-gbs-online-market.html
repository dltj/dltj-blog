  content: "From my perspective, the potential monopoly is specifically on the new
    market opened up to Google by the settlement -- the right to sell electronic copies
    of books published before Jan 5 2009, especially those that are not commercially
    available.  No more and no less than this. \r\n\r\nFor any other seller to sell
    access to books in this market opened up by the settlement, they'd need to make
    individual agreements with individual rightsholders (after finding them), or risk
    being sued. Google, by virtue of the settlement, is the only entity that has a
    legal ability to sell these works, without being sued, and without tracking down
    and making bilateral agreements with every rightsholder. \r\n\r\nNow, while I
    said 'no more and no less', it could be argued that without access to THAT market,
    pre-2009 books, especially non-commercially-available ones, without haivng to
    make individual agreements with every rightsholder--that without that, anyone
    else is going to have trouble competing with google, that this is the critical
    mass that will make google unbeatable in the e-book market in general.  Perhaps
    so, so perhaps it is more than this, but it all starts from this. (And it is only
    about e-books, not print books). \r\n\r\nThe ability to legally sell that huge
    volume of books without individual agreements with every possible rightsholder
    is something that ONLY google will have (unless someone else can get sued and
    get a class action settlement--a class action settlement is pretty much the only
    way to get that right!), and is a pretty huge advantage. \r\n\r\nPeter Brantley's
    blog has some pretty good citations to arguments to this effect. For instance,
    \r\nhttp://blogs.lib.berkeley.edu/shimenawa.php/2008/11/06/class-action-monopoly\r\n\r\nAnd
    here's an essay by James Grimmelman that I was pointed to by Brantley's blog that
    discusses this issue, among others, and is pretty essential reading:\r\n\r\nhttp://laboratorium.net/archive/2008/11/08/principles_and_recommendations_for_the_google_book"

  content: The problem of monopolistic control over the distribution of pre-January
    5th books is an issue, and James Grimmelman's posting sets up a good discussion
    of that.  I'm more concerned, I guess, about the prospective activities, and there
    it would seem that Google is not given any preferential treatment.  There would
    seem to be issues with the <em>Book Rights Registry</em> with regards to the potential
    for antitrust problems, but this wouldn't necessarily result in a monopoly for
    Google.

---
<p>The blog post title is a serious question -- it is one that I need some help figuring out:  What Does the Google Book Settlement Mean for the Online Book Market?  There have been stories and speculation about how Google is going to turn the <a href="http://books.google.com/googlebooks/agreement/" title="Google Book Search Settlement Agreement">settlement</a> for the <a href="http://dockets.justia.com/docket/court-nysdce/case_no-1:2005cv08136/case_id-273913/" title="The Author's Guild et al v. Google Inc. - 1:2005cv08136 - Justia Federal District Court Filings and Dockets">class-action lawsuit</a> against its <a href="http://books.google.com/googlebooks/library.html" title="Google Book Search Library Project">library book scanning project</a> into a monopoly -- or in the case of the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/02/publisher-speculates-about-amazongoogle-e-book-duopoly.ars" title="Publisher speculates about Amazon/Google e-book "duopoly" - Ars Technica">recent Ars Technica article</a>, a duopoly -- of online publishing.  I just don't see it happening without the publishers explicitly allowing it to happen.</p>
<p>The crux of the issue is in the definition of a "book"; according to the preliminary settlement agreement (paragraph 1.16, page 3, emphasis added):<br />
<blockquote>&ldquo;Book&rdquo; means a written or printed work that (a) if a &ldquo;United States work,&rdquo; as defined in 17 U.S.C. &sect; 101, has been registered with the United States Copyright Office as of the Notice Commencement Date, (b) <strong>on or before the Notice Commencement Date, was published or distributed to the public or made available for public access</strong> as a set of written or printed sheets of paper bound together in hard copy form under the authorization of the work&rsquo;s U.S. copyright owner, and (c) as of the Notice Commencement Date, is subject to a Copyright Interest.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Notice Commencement Date was defined as January 5, 2009 in the <a href="http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/new-york/nysdce/1:2005cv08136/273913/64/" title="The Author's Guild et al v. Google Inc. Document 64 - :: Justia Docs">court's order granting preliminary settlement approval</a> (paragraph 16, page 4).  In other words, the definition of "book" as it relates to the settlement is something registered with the copyright office and published <em>before January 5, 2009</em>.  The settlement does not cover books published after that date.  If publishers want books published after that date to appear in the Google Book Search service, they must use the <a href="http://books.google.com/googlebooks/publishers.html" title="Google Book Search">Google Books Partners Program</a>.  If Google scans a book that was registered and published after January 5th, it would appear that they would be subject to another lawsuit since the settlement agreement under consideration by the court provides no protection for such scans.</p>
<p>So what am I missing?</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>There is nothing in the settlement agreement that covers books registered and published after January 5th.</li>
<li>Publishers have a choice to use one or more distribution channels:  bricks-and-mortar stores, e-commerce of physical copies, selling digital copies, adding digital copies to Google Book Search, and any other scheme they might dream up.</li>
<li>Publishers don't seem to be shifting their distribution activities to a Google-only model through the publisher partners program.</li>
<li>A library will still need to purchase books for newly published materials through the channels that publishers choose.</li>
<li>Google may face new lawsuits if it scans books from libraries that were registered/published after January 5, 2009.</li>
<li>A subscription to the anticipated library licensing scheme for the Google Book Search database is not a substitute for traditional library collection development.</li>
</ol>
<p>Are pundits and prognosticators assuming that the influence of the availability of book scanned from libraries published prior to January 5th will force publishers to put their newly-published content into Google Book Search?  Is it conceivable that Google Book Search will be in such a dominant position as to compel publishers to release materials <em>only</em> through Google Books Publisher Partner Program?  </p>
<p>If you see things differently, please help me out here...</p>
