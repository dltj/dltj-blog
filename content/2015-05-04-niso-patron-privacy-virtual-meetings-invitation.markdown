<p><em>This article has been translated into <a href="http://www.prchecker.info/~lib/niso-pl.html" title="Od Niso: Zaproszenie do Niso Patron Prywatność wirtualnych spotkań">Polish</a>.</em></p>
<p>Over the next couple months, <acronym title="National Information Standards Organization">NISO</acronym> is managing a project to "develop a Consensus Framework to Support Patron Privacy in Digital Library and Information Systems." ((From NISO's <a href="http://www.niso.org/news/pr/view?item_key=94b2624667c86e5c85a42d3ad8b7ed479234f570" title="Mellon Grant Awarded to NISO to Explore Patron Privacy in Library and Publisher Systems | National Information Standards Organization">March 11, 2015, press release </a> about the project.))  I'm honored and excited to be on the panel exploring this topic and creating the recommendations as this is a topic <a href="/tag/privacy/">I've written about extensively on this blog</a>.  In May and June, NISO is conducting virtual meetings on four topics that will lead up to a day and a half in-person discussion at the <a href="http://alaac15.ala.org/" title="2015 ALA Annual Conference"><acronym title="American Library Association">ALA annual meeting at the end of June in San Francisco</acronym></a>.  Reproduced below is the invitation for people to listen in on the virtual meeting discussions.  <del datetime="2015-05-04T21:00:59+00:00">I hope (and expect) that there will be a twitter hashtag for those participating in the call (whether on the panel or in the audience) to add their thoughts.</del>  <ins datetime="2015-05-04T21:00:59+00:00">The <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23nisoprivacy&src=typd" title="Search Twitter for #nisoprivacy">#nisoprivacy</a> hashtag will be used to gather the discussion online.</ins></p>
<blockquote><p>As <a href="http://www.niso.org/news/pr/view?item_key=94b2624667c86e5c85a42d3ad8b7ed479234f570" title="Mellon Grant Awarded to NISO to Explore Patron Privacy in Library and Publisher Systems<br />
     - National Information Standards Organization">announced last month</a>, NISO, the National Information Standards Organization has launched an initiative to develop a Consensus Framework to Support Patron Privacy in Digital Library and Information Systems with the generous support from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. The project involves a series of community discussions on how libraries, publishers and information systems providers can build better privacy protection into their operations and the subsequent formulation of a framework document on the privacy of patron data in these systems.</p>
<p>We are pleased to announce the availability of a limited number of listen-only "seats" to the virtual meetings that comprise the first phase of the project.  The virtual meetings will involve a range of industry participants including librarians, publishers, system vendors, legal experts and general non-profit participants, discussing various 'lenses' of patron privacy.  The dates and times of these events are scheduled as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Patron privacy in internal library systems: Thursday, May 7, 10:00 am-1:00 pm ET</li>
<li>Patron privacy in vendor systems: Thursday, May 21, 10:00 am-1:00 pm ET</li>
<li>Patron privacy in publisher systems: Friday, May 22, 9:00 am-12 noon ET</li>
<li>Legal frameworks influencing data sharing and policies: Friday, June 19, 1:00-4:00 pm ET</li>
</ul>
<p>If you would like to attend any of these meetings as a listen-only guest, please fill out the RSVP form at https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/niso-patron-privacy.  [Registration for each meeting will close at noon Eastern time the day before the meeting.]</p>
<p>Each of these virtual meetings will be a three-hour web-based session designed to lay the groundwork for an in-person meeting at the conclusion of the American Library Association meeting in San Francisco, CA in June.   We plan to make a live stream of that meeting available to the community.  More information about that video stream of the meeting will be distributed next month.</p>
<p>Following the in-person meeting, a Framework document will be completed detailing the privacy principles and recommendations agreed to by the participants, and then circulated for public comment and finalization. More information, including a version of the project proposal, is available on the NISO website at: http://www.niso.org/topics/tl/patron_privacy/.</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest in this important topic that faces the library and information communities.</p></blockquote>
