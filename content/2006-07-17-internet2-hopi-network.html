    is true enough (I get around 3.5 sleeved discs in the space of a single slim jewel

    increased need for checksum discs and other error-correction schemes should some

<blockquote>
<h2>Internet2 and Level 3 to Deploy Next Generation Nationwide Research Network</h2>
<p><i>The new Internet2 Network, a dynamic, innovative and cost-effective hybrid optical and packet network, will provide next-generation production services as well as a platform for the  development of new networking ideas and techniques.</i><br />
<a href="http://networks.internet2.edu" title="Internet2 Networks Home Page">http://networks.internet2.edu</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 3em;">
Internet2  has entered into a partnership with <a href="http://www.level3.com/" title="Level 3 Communications, Inc.">Level 3 Communications</a>, a leading  national telecommunications carrier, to  provide the U.S. research and education community with a dynamic, innovative and cost-effective hybrid optical and packet network. An  extension of the Internet2 cutting-edge tradition, the new network is designed  to provide next-generation production services as well as a platform for the  development of new networking ideas and techniques. Internet2  is committed to ensuring community involvement in the development,  implementation, and operations of the new network.</p>
<p>The  new <a href="http://networks.internet2.edu/" title="Internet2 Networks Home Page">Internet2 Network</a> will be deployed nationally over 13,000 miles of  dedicated fiber, providing complete community control of the optical  layer and highly granular lightpath services that can be provisioned  dynamically. It  will provide short-term and long-term waves, as well as on-demand or advanced  reservation "lightpath" scheduling. The IP network, corresponding to the  current <a href="http://abilene.internet2.edu/" title="http://abilene.internet2.edu/">Abilene</a> footprint, will be built on the optical network. A basic connectivity package for direct connectors is expected to include two 10 Gbps  waves, one for IP and one for point-to-point optical services.</p>
<p><i>Optical  (Layer 1) network characteristics:</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Initial deployment - 10 x 10 Gbps  wavelengths along network footprint</li>
<li>Maximum capacity - 80 x 10 Gbps  wavelengths</li>
<li>Scalability - potential migration to  40 Gbps and 100 Gbps capabilities</li>
<li>Flexibility - support for sub-wavelength (e.g., 1 GigE) dynamic provisioning across every  wave on the network backbone.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Level 3 carrier agreement provides reliability and unprecedented community control over the networking infrastructure, without taking on the risks of equipment sparing and obsolescence as well as the burden of substantial operational responsibilities.  Level 3 will be responsible for meeting a Service Level Agreement (SLA).  The buildout of the network will happen over several months, with a target completion in the fall of 2007. The transition to the new network will not disrupt existing connectivity and services.

<p>The <a href="http://networks.internet2.edu/" title="Internet2 Networks Home Page">Internet2 Networks page</a> has a description that is a little bit more approachable:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Internet2 and Level 3 Communications, Inc. will develop and deploy a new nationwide network and new services to enhance and support the advanced needs of the academic and research community. This new network initially will offer Internet2 members 100 gigabits per second (Gbps) of capacity, more than 10 times that of the <a href="http://abilene.internet2.edu/" title="http://abilene.internet2.edu/">current Internet2 backbone network</a>, and will be designed to easily scale to add capacity as Internet2 members requirements evolve over time. Based on input and feedback from the research and education community, including experience gained with the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061214094627/http://networks.internet2.edu:80/hopi/" title="The HOPI Home Page">Hybrid Optical and Packet Infrastructure</a> (HOPI) project, the network will be designed to support a full range of production IP services as well as new on-demand, dedicated optical wavelength services to support the most demanding network applications and experimentation.

<p>Okay, maybe that description isn't all that more approachable either.  The thing is this:  the research and development community are pushing the raw networking capabilities farther and farther.  "Optical wavelength services" may not mean much to you -- perhaps about as much as the intricate chemical dance that turns petroleum into gasoline, plastics, chapstick and bubble gum <footnote><span class="removed_link" title="http://www.cheminst.ca/ncw/articles/1994_butylrubber_e.html">Butyl Rubber is in Bubble Gum</span> and <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.allsealsinc.com/butyl.htm">you need petroleum to make butyl rubber</span>.  <i>gack</i></footnote> -- but the comparison is not too much of a stretch.  They've figured out how to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength-division_multiplexing" title="Wavelength-division multiplexing - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">send multiple frequencies of light down the same piece of fibre-optic cable</a>, effectively multiplying its capacity.  The neat thing about the Internet2 work is that, should you need it, it sounds like you'll be able to sign up for a point-to-point lightwave frequency to do with what you need.  (You'll probably need a pretty good reason, of course.)</p>
<p>Oh, and the stationwagon comment?  When you think you have a really zippy network connection, someone will (should?) bring up an <a href="http://www.bpfh.net/sysadmin/never-underestimate-bandwidth.html" title="Never underestimate the bandwidth....">old internet adage</a> which says "Never underestimate the bandwidth of a station wagon full of tapes."  (This, of course, shouldn't be confused with the term "<a href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/jargon/S/sneakernet.html" title="http://www.faqs.org/docs/jargon/S/sneakernet.html">sneakernet</a>" -- the bandwidth speed and capacity at which you could walk your flash drive over to your colleague rather than trying to e-mail, FTP, torrent, webify, or send via carrier pigeon that document that the two of you have been working on.)</p>
