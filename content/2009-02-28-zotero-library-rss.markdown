  content: Thanks for the suggestion CJ.  I took a look at Mendeley earlier this year,
    but at the time didn't see compelling reasons to move away from Zotero.  I've
    been using Zotero since the version 0.8 days, and have some effort invested in
    my citation library and Mendeley didn't represent a big enough gain to gravitate
    to it instead.

  content: I haven't been back to this since <a href="http://www.zotero.org/blog/follow-libraries-and-collections-with-feeds/"
    rel="nofollow">Zotero started natively supporting RSS feeds</a>.  It is quite
    possible that the page structure on the Zotero site changed, so the Yahoo! Pipes
    configuration no longer works.

<div style="border: 2px solid red; text-color: black; background: #EEE; padding:1em;">Note!  A new feature on the Zotero website does away with the need to use this Yahoo! Pipe.  RSS feeds are now generated by the Zotero website itself.  <a href="http://www.zotero.org/blog/follow-libraries-and-collections-with-feeds/" title="Zotero Blog  &amp;raquo; Blog Archive   &amp;raquo; Follow Libraries and Collections with Feeds">Read more about it</a> on the Zotero blog.</div>
<p>Earlier this week, the Zotero team <a href="http://www.zotero.org/blog/zotero-15-beta-released-join-us-in-the-clouds/" title="Zotero Blog  &amp;raquo; Blog Archive   &amp;raquo; Zotero 1.5 Beta Released: Join Us In The Clouds">released its 1.5 Beta version</a>.  Among the much anticipated features is the ability to <a href="http://www.zotero.org/support/sync" title="sync    [Zotero Documentation]">synchronize citations</a> among computers and with a display at the Zotero website.  And if you set the profile permissions on the website, anyone can view your display of citations as well.  As <a href="http://www.dancohen.org/" title="Dan Cohen&amp;#8217;s Digital Humanities Blog">Dan Cohen</a>, Director of the Center for History and New Media where Zotero is being created, <a href="http://twitter.com/dancohen/statuses/1247887132" title="Twitter / Dan Cohen: Enjoying browsing the libr ...">points out</a>, it is fun to see what others have added to their Zotero library.  You might even want to watch what others have saved to their library.  That is where this Zotero-to-RSS mashup comes in.</p>
<p>I've <span class="removed_link" title="http://pipes.yahoo.com/peteratohiolink/zoterolibraryrss">set up a Yahoo! Pipe</span> that examines a Zotero user's citation page and turns it into an RSS feed.  There is one prerequisite -- the user must have turned on the profile option on the Zotero website to "Publish Entire Library" (see figure 1).  If you want to publish your own citations, you'll need to set this by using the "Settings" link in the upper right corner of any Zotero.org page when you have signed in.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_779" align="alignnone" width="690" caption="Figure 1. Zotero Privacy Settings"]<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/zotero_privacy_settings1.png" alt="Zotero Privacy Settings" title="Zotero Privacy Settings" width="690" height="241" class="size-full wp-image-779" />[/caption]</p>
<p>To use the Yahoo! Pipe, you will need two bits of information:  the Zotero username and the Zotero user number.  These bits of information are available in the URL of a library on the Zotero website.  For instance, the URL to my Zotero page is::</p>
<div style="font-size: 110%; font-family:monospace">http://www.zotero.org/<span style="color:red">dltj</span>/<span style="color:green">683</span></div>
<p>The <span style="color:red;font-family:monospace">dltj</span> is my Zotero Username and <span style="color:green;font-family:monospace">683</span> is my Zotero User Number.  Similarly, for <a href="https://www.zotero.org/dancohen/2">Dan Cohen's Zotero page</a>, his Username is <span style="color:red;font-family:monospace">dancohen</span> and his User Number is <span style="color:green;font-family:monospace">2</span>.  With that information you can go to the <span class="removed_link" title="http://pipes.yahoo.com/peteratohiolink/zoterolibraryrss">Zotero-to-RSS Yahoo! Pipe</span> (<span class="removed_link" title="http://pipes.yahoo.com/peteratohiolink/zoterolibraryrss">http://pipes.yahoo.com/peteratohiolink/zoterolibraryrss</span>), and plug it into the form (see figure 2).  Select the "Run Pipe" button and after a few seconds you'll see the results.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_780" align="alignnone" width="690" caption="Figure 2. Yahoo! Pipe Configuration"]<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/yahoo-pipe-config1.png" alt="Yahoo! Pipe Configuration" title="Yahoo! Pipe Configuration" width="690" height="122" class="size-full wp-image-780" />[/caption]</p>
<p>If you see an error "error fetching" warning with a "403 Forbidden" message, that means the user has not opened up their Zotero library for public viewing.  But if they (or you!) have, then you can use the "Get as RSS" link as a way to track additions to the library.  For instance, I've added my Zotero library feed as a "Blog" source to <a href="http://friendfeed.com/dltj" title="Peter Murray - FriendFeed">my FriendFeed profile</a>.</p>
