  content: If it's Public Domain, why would they need to add a Creative Commons license?
    Shouldn't they just does this record is in the Public Domain? Or do people not
    understand what Public Domain means and it has to be spelled out?

  content: Ryan -- the issue is that the ability to assert rights on records is in
    dispute. Some think that a bibliographic record can have a statement of rights
    attached to it, so the public domain declaration is an explicit statement. The
    nature of the records hasn't been tested in the courts, so we don't really know
    for sure.

  content: Ok, that makes sense, but as an outsider I would see it as uncopyrightable
    due to the records just being a collection of facts (as you mention in your last
    sentence).

  content: "It's not redundant, but it's also not \"viral\". \r\n\r\nIt's not redundant,
    because alone among CC licenses, CC0 works fine for something that may not have
    been copyrightable in the first place. CC0 says \"IF this was copyrightable, we
    waive our rights.\" No problem. It's disputable if it was copyrightable or not,
    CC0 takes away the dispute. \r\n\r\nBut it's not viral, because if someone else
    edits the record, and their edits are (hypothetically) copyrightable -- the CC0
    does nothing to keep them from excersizing that copyright on their edits however
    they want.  Likewise, the CC0 does nothing to prevent OCLC from removing that
    588 if they want. Nothing in CC0 says you have to keep the CC0 decleration intact
    when you re-use the data, and nothing in CC0 restricts anything you can do with
    your own \"re-mixing\" of the content, including claiming copyright on your re-mixed
    version (which may or may not hold up in court, depending on if what you added
    was really copyrightable in the first place, but CC0 won't effect it one way or
    another)."

<p><a href="http://infomotions.com/" title="Infomotions, LLC">Eric Morgan</a> posted a <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.culture.libraries.ngc4lib/9018" title="NGC4LIB mailing list message with the subject 'university of florida' by Eric Morgan on March 18,2011 | Gmane">message</a> to the Next Generation Catalog for Libraries mailing list this morning that points to a <a href="http://www.uflib.ufl.edu/catmet/creativecommons.html" title="Creative Commons License | University of Florida George A. Smathers Libraries">announcement</a> by the <a href="http://www.uflib.ufl.edu/" title="University of FLorida George A. Smathers Libraries homepage">University of Florida library</a> that they are now applying a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/" title="CC0 1.0 Universal | Creative Commons">Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication</a> statement to <abbr title="MAchine Readable Cataloging">MARC</abbr> records they create.  Their announcement says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Beginning March 2011, the University of Florida Smathers Libraries implemented a policy to include a Creative Commons license in all of its original cataloging records. The records are considered public domain with unrestricted downstream use for any purpose.</p>
<p>The following MARC 588 field (Source of Description Note) is added to new records contributed to WorldCat. It has not been added retrospectively to University of Florida original records in WorldCat.</p>
<p style="padding-left:2em;font-family:monospace;">588::|a This bibliographic record is available under a Creative Commons CC0 license. The University of Florida Libraries, as creator of this bibliographic record, has waived all rights to it worldwide under copyright law, including all related and neighboring rights, to the extent allowed by law. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their announcement page also provides links to some examples from the OPAC.  Scroll down to the bottom of the page to see the CC0 graphic and declaration.</p>

</ul>
<p>The University of Florida joins <a href="http://www.lib.umich.edu/open-access-bibliographic-records" title="Open Access Bibliographic Records Available for Download and Use | Library Information Technology | MLibrary">University of Michigan</a> in making original cataloging records available under CC0.  To refresh your memory CC0 "Public Domain Dedication" statement (<a href="http://www.plagiarismtoday.com/2009/02/25/cc0-waiving-copyrights/" title="CC0: Waiving Copyrights">it isn't a license!</a>) says:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>The person who associated a work with this deed has <b>dedicated</b> the work to the public domain by waiving all of his or her rights to the work worldwide under copyright law, including all related and neighboring rights, to the extent allowed by law.</p>
<p>You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now this is an interesting development because it is a kind of viral declaration of the same sort that <a href="http://wiki.code4lib.org/index.php/OCLC_Policy_Change" title="OCLC Policy Change - Code4Lib">OCLC proposed</a> with the <a href="/article/oclc-review-board-initial-recommendations/">withdrawn</a> draft of the record use policy.  There OCLC was going to add a <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.oclc.org/us/en/bibformats/en/9xx/996.shtm">996 field</span> to all records exported from WorldCat that would say: </p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" style="padding-left:2em;font-family:monospace;">
<tbody>
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="left">996</td>
<td width="10" align="right"></td>
<td width="17" align="left"></td>
<td width="90%" align="left">OCLCWCRUP &Dagger;i Use and transfer of this record is governed by the OCLC&reg; Policy for Use and Transfer of WorldCat&reg; Records &Dagger;u http://purl.org/oclc/wcrup</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This would do something similar except that it would make viral the public domain declaration on records added to OCLC WorldCat.  (It is probably also an oversight that the <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.oclc.org/us/en/bibformats/en/9xx/996.shtm">996 field</span> documentation is still on OCLC's site.)  Does this begin to segment WorldCat into records that can and cannot be used?  Or is it redundant since some think that MARC records, as a recitation of facts, cannot be copyrighted anyway?
