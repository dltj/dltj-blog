  content: "You're welcome, although with the \"in my experience\" qualifier there's
    no need to retract. I suspect the actual situation is complex enough to be difficult
    to prove one way or the other. (E.g., the situation with ARL-class libraries may
    be different than the situation with liberal arts colleges which may be different
    than the situation with...and so on.) \r\n\r\nI'm finding the SOA series fascinating
    and informative. Keep it up!"

<p>No Service Oriented Architecture posting today, but here is a glimpse of the topic of the next one -- the title is:  "Web Services: A means to a Service Oriented Architecture end."  In the meantime I wanted to thank everyone for their public and private comments, and to ask to keep 'em coming.  The big push for writing about SOA this week was a lead up to a meeting of the OhioLINK Technical Advisory Council (TAC) today.  On TAC's agenda was a question about looking at SOA as a design strategy for new and migrated services.  These blog postings served several purposes:  1) propel the topic a little further in the library community [presupposing that it was a worthy topic]; 2) serve as background information for today's meeting; 3) flush out comments from the library community [which it did -- thanks again!]; and 4) form the basis of a whitepaper on SOA at OhioLINK.  TAC agreed to keep looking at it and endorsed the writing of the whitepaper.  Keep the comments and observations coming!</p>
<p>On a somewhat related note, I wanted to tie up a loose end from this summer:</p>
<blockquote><p>
In academic libraries, in my experience, there has been a decline in the use of library catalogs. This experience could be verified in the ARL supplementary statistics for at least that population of libraries (I think those numbers are password-protected, so it might be a challenge to try to use them). When I get back on the ground and have some time, I will either offer confirmation of that supposition or retract it.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I retract the statement.  Although it has been true in my direct experience, I cannot find any statistics &mdash; for either academic libraries or the broader community &mdash; to back up that experience.  Thanks, Walt, for calling me on it and keeping me on the straight-and-narrow.</p>
