<p>Sue Polanka, head of reference and instruction at the main library of Wright State University, sent a message to the OhioLINK membership today about a new blog she is moderating called No Shelf Required:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.libraries.wright.edu/noshelfrequired/" title="No Shelf Required blog homepage">No Shelf Required</a> provides a forum for discussion among librarians, publishers, distributors, aggregators, and others interested in the publishing and information industry.  The discussion will focus on the issues, concepts, current and future practices of Ebook publishing including:  finding, selecting, licensing, policies, business models, usage (tracking), best practices, and promotion/marketing.  The concept of the blog is to have open discussion, propose ideas, and provide feedback on the best ways to implement Ebooks in library settings.  The blog will be a moderated discussion with timely feature articles and product reviews available for discussion and comment. </p>
<p>No Shelf Required will be moderated by Sue Polanka, Wright State University.  The role of the moderator will be to articulate discussion topics, provide feature articles and product reviews, and ask poignant questions to the group in order to stimulate open discussion and collaborative learning about Ebooks.  The moderator will also provide audio content in the form of interviews with librarians and those in the publishing industry.</p></blockquote>
<p>The blog has been running for about a week, and already has topics like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.libraries.wright.edu/noshelfrequired/2008/02/21/should-ebooks-be-updated/" title="No Shelf Required: Should eBooks be updated?">Should eBooks be updated?</a> (A topic for discussion)</li>

</ul>
<p>It sounds like it is going to be an interesting place to keep an eye on, particularly since ebooks can/could be a disruptive influence on library services.  Good luck, Sue!
