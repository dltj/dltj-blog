I reached a new milestone this month. 
A minor one in the grand scheme of things, but one worthy of a few remarks nonetheless. 
This month marks my longest tenure with an employer at five years and 10 months. 
I've now worked at Index Data longer than I had at OhioLINK a decade ago, and this has hardly felt like almost six years. 

Seven employers in 31 years. 
All of it in library technology—one of the last places I thought I would land with an undergraduate degree in Systems Analysis. 
Seven doesn't seem like a lot, but at almost all of them I thought "I could see myself completing my career here." 
(This definitely feels true for my current employer.) 
But life intervened and a change was made...always for the better. 

I'm so grateful for all of the people that mentored me and the couple that kicked my butt along the way (in retrospect, at least). 
Hopefully I've managed to give back in equal measure to those coming into the field.
