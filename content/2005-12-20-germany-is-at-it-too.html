<p>This just in -- at least to my INBOX -- Germany is working on a unified repository as well.  Called the eSciDoc project, it closely mirrors what the DRC is going to be:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The aim of the <a href="http://www.mpg.de/en" title="Homepage of the Max Planck Society">Max-Planck Society</a>&rsquo;s sInfo program is to significantly improve the effectiveness of its<br />
scientists and institutes by systematically exploiting the new technical opportunities (Internet,<br />
digitalization, communication, open access). It addresses many facets of scientific work: information<br />
retrieval, processing and evaluating information, distributing and storing information, scientific work in<br />
the laboratory and at the desk, scientific work performed by individuals and in groups.  </p>
<p>The <strong>eSciDoc Project</strong> which is sponsored by <a href="http://www.bmbf.de/en/index.php" title="http://www.bmbf.de/en/index.php">BMBF</a> [Federal Ministry of Education and Research], is an important component of sInfo and will<br />
establish a sustainable infrastructure for scientific information, communication and the distribution of<br />
research results via Open Access, using the concrete example of the Max-Planck Society. The<br />
components developed will be offered to interested communities as reusable solutions in order to put<br />
them in a position to also contribute components for the emerging global knowledge network and<br />
develop further community-specific services on the basis of the infrastructure.  </p>
<p>The strategic partnership between MPG and FIZ can ensure the sustainability of the solutions<br />
developed and also guarantee their reusability by other, particularly German institutions. Appropriate<br />
agreements have been reached as part of a collaboration contract. FIZ Karlsruhe is pursuing the aim of<br />
establishing itself as a partner to scientific institutions in setting up and operating information,<br />
publication and communication platforms, and thereby playing a central role in the entire scientific<br />
infrastructure in Germany. The eSciDoc-Projekt is part of a greater strategy for both partners. As a<br />
result, both partners bring considerable resources of their own which will contribute significantly to the<br />
success of the project. </p>
<p>In the first phase of the project &ndash; completed by 31.03.2005 &ndash; a comprehensive analysis of requirements<br />
was carried out for the area of scientific communication. At the same time, the technical alternatives<br />
were evaluated as part of analyses of the state of the art and research. Both aspects fed into the<br />
detailed definition of the project. A summary of the work carried out and the results of Phase 1 can be<br />
found in Section 2.  </p>
<p>In the further phases of the project until the 2nd quarter of 2009, the focus will be on the one hand on<br />
developing a flexible and extensible basic infrastructure which as such will be highly innovative through<br />
its scalability and power, and on the other on implementing programs and processes for realizing four<br />
application scenarios:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Scholarly Workbench &ndash; a web-based work environment for opening up and processing previously<br />
inaccessible materials for research purposes, to facility work with them and the exchange of<br />
information on them; Open Access materials will be made available to the entire community.
</li>
<li>Publication Management &ndash; an application for the structured registration and management of all the<br />
publication data of MPIs and the basis for making the research output of the MPS available via Open<br />
Access. Special emphasis will be placed on the integration of supplementary material as well as<br />
integration into general and specific Search & Retrieval services. Supporting measures financed by<br />
the Society&rsquo;s own resources, are the implementation of an Open Access policy, the definition and<br />
support of Open Access licenses and a strategy for institutional self-archiving.
</li>
<li>eLib &ndash; the local loading of electronic journals and databases to secure long-term availability and<br />
prepare value added services. Setting up eLib will be financed by the MPS&rsquo; own resources.
</li>
<li>eLab Journal &ndash; application for documenting experiments which manages analytical results, methods,<br />
publications, chemical compounds, etc. in an integrated form, and which in its guise as an information<br />
system, ensures long-term access via comfortable search functions, thereby enabling the<br />
experiments carried out to be reproduced at a later date.
</li>
<p>These services are based on the eSciDoc framework which will be gradually adapted to meet their<br />
needs. They represent central building blocks of the MPS integrated Knowledge Space. </ul>
