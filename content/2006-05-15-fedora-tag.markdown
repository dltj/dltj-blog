    operating system</i> \r\n\r\nAs someone who's subscribed to the \"fedora\" tag
    on del.icio.us, I would beg to differ!  Behold -- http://del.icio.us/tag/fedora\r\n\r\nHow
    about fedora-dr (digital repository)?  It's simple, short, and doesn't misrepresent
    Fedora as something its not.\r\n\r\nI like that fedora-info refers to the official
    Fedora website, but it's not obvious that the \"-\" is indicative of a \".\" which
    may or may not be tag-friendly.  If \".\" is tag friendly, I think \"fedora.info\"
    is an obvious and good choice for us.  Otherwise, I'm leaning a bit towards fedora-dr.\r\n\r\nBack
    to you. :)"

  content: "Give it time -- the others will see the light soon.  :-)\r\n\r\nThe talk
    on the #fedora-users IRC channel this afternoon favored \"fedora-repo\" despite
    the visualizations of a large Chevy Malibu filled with a trunk of 9-track tapes.
    Don't get the reference?  See the <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087995/plotsummary\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">IMDB entry for the 1984 movie <i>Repo Man</i></a>.  (Somehow
    I can visualize Carl and Thorny driving said Chevy Malibu...)  I must admit, though,
    that I like \"fedora-dr\" better than \"fedora.info\" <i>or</i> \"fedora-info\"
    at this point."

  content: "I appreciate the Repo Man reference. :)  The visual of Carl and Thorny
    is <i>priceless</i>.  Photoshop it and include it in a talk at the Fedora conference.
    ;)\r\n\r\nSo it's down to fedora-dr and fedora-repo, currently?  \r\n\r\nI wonder
    if this warrants discussion on the fedora-users mailing list.\r\n\r\nKeep fightin'
    the good fight, soldier, and I'll do the same."

  content: "Perhaps a better approach would be to simply tag it with \"fedora\" but
    always make sure we include an additional tag that differentiates it from the
    purloined version from Redhat.  Maybe just throw in a \"repository\" tag.\r\n\r\nIt
    feels to me like a moral retreat if we modify a chosen tag name in deference to
    the majority."

  content: "I share Peter's concerns about tag conjunction and I really appreciate
    the simplicity of having just the one tag.  Even in a two-tag world, \"fedora\"
    and \"repository\" still doesn't quite disambiguate our Fedora from the other
    Fedora -- there will be links tagged with both that point at repositories containing
    the fedora-linux code, or software for it.  Or repositories, used in the most
    general sense, installed atop fedora-linux. \r\n\r\nWe can, of course, have our
    cake and eat it too by tagging with \"fedora\" for moral satisfaction -and- \"fedora-dr\"
    for the simple discovery we seek.\r\n\r\nOur Fedora deserves its own tag, in my
    humble opinion, and it's unlikely to think that it will own the rights to that
    name any time soon."

I'll claim modest ignorance, as I did in the comments, to the social order surrounding tags, but would point out that it is unlikely that at the moment our use of the 'fedora' tag by itself would be drown out by its usage for a certain flavor of the Linux operating system.</p>
<p>So until the <strong>F</strong>lexible <strong>E</strong>xtensible <strong>D</strong>igital <strong>O</strong>bject <strong>R</strong>epository <strong>A</strong>rchitecture is known as /the/ FEDORA, what convention should we use as a tag?  "fedora-repository"?  Kinda long.  "fedora-repo"?  Brings to mind a vision of a thug repossessing some geek's LAMP box.  "fedora-info"?  It works, is a link to the project website, but it doesn't really <em>say</em> much.</p>
