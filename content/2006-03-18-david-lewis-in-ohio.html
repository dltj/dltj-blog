<p>OhioLINK was pleased to host David Lewis, Director of the Indiana University/Purdue University at Indianapolis Library, to talk about "Disruptive Innovation and the Academic Library".  The <a href="https://scholarworks.iupui.edu/handle/1805/557">PowerPoint of his presentation</a> is in IUPUI's institutional repository, and I recommend it as a gentle visual introduction to the application of Clayton Christensen's Theory of Disruptive Innovations to the field of academic libraries.  (See <a href="https://scholarworks.iupui.edu/browse?value=Lewis%2C+David+W.&amp;type=author">his earlier works</a> for a textual introduction or consult the <a href="/article/christensen-bibliography/">Jester's bibliography</a>.)
