In early October, NISO will be hosting a <a href="http://www.niso.org/news/events/2015/October_discovery/" title="NISO Forum: The Future of Discovery - National Information Standards Organization">two-day forum on the future of resource discovery in libraries</a>.  This is an in-person meeting to extend the work of Marshall Breeding's paper on the same topic that was published earlier this year:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.niso.org/publications/white_papers/discovery/" title="Future of Library Resource Discovery (short URL) - National Information Standards Organization">Full paper</a>, PDF, 53 pages</li>
<li><a href="http://www.niso.org/publications/isq/2015/v27no1/breeding/" title="http://www.niso.org/publications/isq/2015/v27no1/breeding/">Summary</a> from Information Standards Quarterly, Spring 2015, 27(1): pp. 24-30. </li>
</ul>
<p>Marshall will start the forum with a presentation on the topics presented in the paper.  Participants will then break up into smaller groups to go into more depth on the ideas and the implications with reporting back to the larger group.  I will finish up the forum on the second day with a keynote that wraps together the ideas expressed during the meeting and a vision of where resource discovery in libraries is heading.</p>
<p>If you can, attend the face-to-face meeting with all the rich interaction of the breakout sessions.  If you can make it to Baltimore on October 5th and 6th, sign up to watch and interact through a live webcast.  Details on registration are on the <a href="http://www.niso.org/news/events/2015/October_discovery/" title="NISO Forum: The Future of Discovery - National Information Standards Organization">NISO web page for the forum</a>.</p>
