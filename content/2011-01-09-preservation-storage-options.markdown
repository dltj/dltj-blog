  content: "Who says you have to only store the data once? I just did a quick calculation
    with Amazon's online calculator, and using the above figures came up with $180
    a month, so round that up to $200. Store it on Amazon S3 East and West, and you've
    doubled your cost to $400, but increased your redundancy against loss.\r\n\r\nBackblaze.com
    has several blog articles on how they are managing a massive amount of storage
    relatively inexpensively (67TB for $7,800 - http://ryancollins.org/A8G )"

  content: "Storing it twice certainly decreases the chance that something will be
    lost.  I know what trips me up, though, is the notion that any loss is unacceptable,
    if impossible to achieve.  For the library and archiving profession, long term
    storage is measured in centuries (or longer if you think about some of the artifacts
    held in various libraries now).  We don't have a good handle on the risks associate
    with that.\r\n\r\nI'm going to paraphrase a comment from someone in the audience
    and hope I get the numbers right.  The Library of Congress has 350 petabytes of
    data under its stewardship and expects to \"lose\" 500 gigabytes per year (through
    format obsolescence, failed equipment, etc).  500GB seems like a lot, but this
    person compared it to the combined surface area of a typical 300 page book.  The
    amount of data loss would be the size of a period on one of those pages.  Which,
    of course, is not comforting if it is <em>your</em> data that is lost.\r\n\r\n
    I have to take the Backblaze numbers with a grain of salt because they didn't
    appear to include the cost of energy, of personnel support, or of activities such
    as ongoing maintenance in their cost estimates.  Companies like Rackspace and
    Amazon Web Services are full-featured, including the cost of the bandwidth to
    get things in and out of those cloud-based services.  It is an apple-to-oranges
    comparison.  It is a really cool post, though, about how it is possible to create
    really low-cost storage pods."

<p>A last-minute change to <a href="/article/alamw11-schedule/">my plans for ALA Midwinter</a> came on Tuesday when I was sought out to fill in for a speaker than canceled at the <span class="removed_link" title="http://connect.ala.org/node/119686">ALCTS Digital Preservation Interest Group meeting</span>.  Options for outsourcing storage and services for preserving digital content has been a recent interest, so I volunteered to combine two earlier <i><acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester">DLTJ</acronym></i> blog posts with some new information and present it to the group for feedback.  The reaction was great, and here is the promised slide deck, links to further information, and some thoughts from the audience response.</p>

In the presentation there is a <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/DataGazetteer/options-in-storage-for-digital-preservation/14" title="Options in Storage for Digital Preservation">Table About Costs</a> that uses a scenario from an <a href="/article/oclc-digital-archive-vs-amazon-s3/">earlier <i><acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester">DLTJ</acronym></i> blog post</a>.  The text of the scenario is:<br />
<blockquote>To examine the similarities and differences in costs, let&rsquo;s use the OhioLINK Satellite Image collection as a prototypical example. It consists of about 2 terabytes (2TB) of high-quality images in TIFF format, with about 7.5GB of data going into the repository each month. In the interest of exploring everything that S3 can do, there is an assumption that approximately 4GB of data will be transferred out of the archive each month; OCLC&rsquo;s Digital Archive does not have a end-user dissemination component.</p></blockquote>
<p>The point of showing this scenario is to show the widest range of costs -- from a storage-only solution like Amazon S3 to a soup-to-nuts service like OCLC Digital Archive.  A word about the redacted costs.  Some of the numbers for OCLC's Digital Archive response (from 2008) came from a confidential quote, so the numbers were removed from the public table.  For the numbers that are publicly listed, the values come from <a href="http://newsbreaks.infotoday.com/nbReader.asp?ArticleId=49018" title="OCLC Introduces High-Priced Digital Archive Service">Barbara Quint's article</a>.</p>

<h2>Some Thoughts</h2>
<p>There was a great deal of discussion after the presentation about how good of a guarantee is good enough.  Amazon S3, offers two levels of availability:  "Designed to provide 99.999999999% durability and 99.99% availability of objects over a given year."  The question was whether that slight risk of loss is "good enough" for our purposes.  Coming to grips with the digital storage, can we (as the librarian profession) get someone from Amazon to talk about what they do to assure that data is available?  Can the terms that they use be translated into terms that we use and understand?  Can we get a level of familiarity and comfort with their storage about what they do to trust them as a long-term data warehouse?  Can we pull out the appropriate questions of the <a href="http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/tools-and-applications/trustworthy-repositories" title="Trustworthy Repositories | Digital Curation Centre">Trusted Repositories Audit &amp; Certification: Criteria and Checklist</a> to see how Amazon S3 measures up?
