  content: The roads are there - the overlay is just shifted down and to the right.  Still
    looks like one could easily get lost in one of those city blocks.

  content: Ah!  Thank you, Andreas.  It is obvious now that you mention it.  It makes
    it even more impressive, I think, when there aren't formal roads between those
    small buildings.

<p>This has to be among the weirdest pieces of unsolicited mail I've ever received.  Nigerian prince?  That is so yesterday.  Virtual pharmacy?  Too much effort.  No, what we want to sell you is a <em>can opener!</em></p>

<p>This came through the general information account at my employer, <a href="http://www.indexdata.com/" title="Index Data">Index Data</a>.  Needless to say, as a boutique software development firm specializing in creating applications for libraries we are <em>not</em> in the market for a can opener.</p>
<p>Curious, I tried to find the company -- it is in the center of this map on <em>Fu'an St</em>:</p>

That is a highly packed area!  I don't think what Google thinks are roads are actually there.  Looking at the map makes me wonder what life is like in that area.</p>
<p>I searched their website for can openers, but I couldn't find one.  They do have knives and cookie cutters and silicone kitchen utensils, so I wonder if can openers is something they are looking to expand into.</p>
