<p>The internet has survived the great <abbr title="Stop Online Piracy Act">SOPA</abbr> blackout, and we're still <a href="#p3624-sopa-pipa">talking about the fallout</a>.  Apple made a major announcement of plans to support textbooks on iPads, but <a href="#p3624-ibooks-author">there are concerns about the implementation</a>.  But the first story this week is about a <a href="#p3624-codeyear">free service geared towards teaching people how to program</a> with weekly lessons throughout 2012.</p>

<p>Code Year is a project of internet startup <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/" title="Learn to code | Codecademy">Codecademy</a>, a service that teaches people <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/courses" title="Courses | Codecademy">how to code</a> (JavaScript only, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120126135201/http://blog.codecademy.com/var-firstpost" title="post[1] = "Updates from Codecademy" - Codecademy Blog">at the moment</a>).

Code Year is free, and it sends an e-mail at the beginning of each week with a link to that week's course.  More questions?  See the <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.codecademy.com/codeyear/week/1#codeyear_faq">frequently asked questions</span>.</p>
<p>What I think is really cool about this is that a group of librarians has self-organized themselves to support each other through the year.  There is a <a href="http://connect.ala.org/codeyear" title="Code Year | ALA Connect">community area on ALA Connect</a> and a list of <a href="http://catcode.pbworks.com/w/page/49680175/Resources" title="Resources | catcode">resources</a> on the <a href="http://catcode.pbworks.com/w/page/49328692/Welcome%20to%20CatCode%21" title="catcode wiki homepage">catcode wiki</a> that includes <a href="http://catcode.pbworks.com/w/browse/#view=ViewFolder&param=Cataloguing%20Code%20Examples" title="Cataloguing Code Examples | catcode">examples tailored to cataloging challenges</a>.  ("catcode" is a unique story onto itself.  It is a wiki created to "help support dialogue between catalogers and coders.")</p>
<h2 id="p3624-ibooks-author">Apple Introduces iBooks Author</h2>
<blockquote><p>Educators so far seem excited about the potential promise of a learning "revolution" enabled by Apple's new iBooks Author app. However, not everyone is feeling that same level of enthusiasm: e-book publishing experts have concerns about the formatting that iBooks Author can output, which isn't fully ePub 2 or ePub 3 compliant. Furthermore, Apple has added a clause to iBooks Author's end user license agreement that prohibits selling e-books created with iBooks Author anywhere but the iBookstore.

<p>Last week saw the big introduction of <a href="http://www.apple.com/education/ibooks-textbooks/" title="iBooks Textbooks for iPad | Apple">iBooks Textbooks for iPad</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/ibooks-author/" title="iBooks Author | Apple">iBooks Author</a> ebook creation utility.  The combination were billed as a promising new way to have students interact with course materials and to have teachers build their own content.  There were some not-so-nice surprises in the implementation, though.  First, the ebook format is close to that of <a href="http://idpf.org/epub/30" title="EPUB 3 | International Digital Publishing Forum">ePub</a> standard from the <a href="http://idpf.org/" title="International Digital Publishing Forum homepage">International Digital Publishing Forum</a>, but strays in enough important ways that the iBooks Textbooks themselves won't be usable on non-Apple devices.  Second, included the End-User License Agreement for the iBooks Author software are terms that says content created with iBooks Author can be given away freely but can only be sold through Apple's iBookstore.  Apple also reserves the right to determine if your work is sold at iBookstore with no recourse for rejected works.  The article above has more details, and the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=apple+%22ibooks+textbooks%22+%22ibooks+author%22&amp;hl=en#q=apple+%22ibooks+textbooks%22+%22ibooks+author%22&amp;hl=en&amp;tbs=cdr:1,cd_min:1/19/2012,cd_max:1/26/2012&amp;prmd=imvnsu&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=nws&amp;ei=-aUgT4SDBIKKsgL6nIWHCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=mode_link&amp;ct=mode&amp;cd=5&amp;ved=0CCIQ_AUoBA&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&amp;fp=a5444d29e38610fe&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=670" title="apple 'ibooks textbooks' 'ibooks author' | Google News Search for Jan 19-26, 2012">press coverage of iBooks Textbooks and iBooks Author</a> has been generally negative so far.</p>
<p><em>Update on 6-Feb-2012:</em> Apple released iBooks Author version 1.0.1 with the only change being <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/apples-lawyers-clean-up-the-sloppy-ibooks-author-eula/4476" title="Apple&amp;#039;s lawyers clean up the sloppy iBooks Author EULA | ZDNet">clarifications to the End-User License Agreement</a>:  "If you want to charge a fee for a work that includes files in the .ibooks format generated using iBooks Author, you may only sell or distribute such work through Apple, and such distribution will be subject to a separate agreement with Apple... This restriction does not apply to the content of such works when distributed in a form that does not include files in the .ibooks format."</p>

<blockquote><p>Leaders in Congress on Friday <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20131022203117/http://idealab.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/01/senator-reid-postpones-pipa-vote.php" title="Senator Reid Postpones PIPA Vote | Talking Points Memo Idea Lab">effectively killed two pieces of anti-online piracy legislation</a> following the increasingly vocal <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130518184944/http://idealab.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/01/sopapipa-blackout-by-the-numbers.php" title="SOPA/PIPA Blackout By the Numbers | Talking Points Memo Idea Lab">protests</a> of tens of thousands of websites and millions of Internet users. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) in the House and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA) in the Senate are, for all practical purposes, dead in the water. </p>
<p>Sure, <a href="http://news.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/01/full-reid-statement-on-pipa.php" title="Full Reid Statement On PIPA | Talking Points Memo News">Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV)</a> and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120126212855/http://judiciary.house.gov/news/01202012.html" title="Statement from Chairman Smith on Senate Delay of Vote on PROTECT IP Act">Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX)</a> used the word &ldquo;postponed&rdquo; in their announcements, saying that Congress would only take a breather, but would certainly not give up for good on its goal of passing some sort of legislation designed to combat overseas &ldquo;rogue&rdquo; websites hosting pirated American content. </p>
<p>But whenever Congress decides to re-engage the online piracy fight &mdash; and it could be a while, given just how acrimonious the debate over the bills became in the last week &mdash; it&rsquo;s almost certain that SOPA and PIPA <em>won&rsquo;t</em> be revived in any recognizable form.

<p>Who would have thought -- grass roots organizations convince major internet presences to "black out" or otherwise inform users of ill-considered provisions (at best) in legislation, and in turn those users bury both houses of Congress with so much anti-<abbr title="Stop Online Piracy Act">SOPA</abbr> and -<abbr title="PROTECT-IP Act">PIPA</abbr> feedback that they effectively kill the bills.  Is this the closest we've come to direct democracy since ancient Athens?  Perhaps!  The article quoted above goes into great detail about the formational elements of SOPA and PIPA and the forces that gathered to stop them.</p>
<p>The response to Wikipedia being blacked out in particular was interesting.  The Washington Post, The Guardian and National Public Radio <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/wikipedia-blackout-an-altwiki-band-aid/2012/01/17/gIQAWbg25P_blog.html" title="Wikipedia Blackout: An #altwiki Band-Aid | The Washington Post">announced that they would answer questions</a> posted to Twitter with the hashtag #altwiki.
