<p>Search Results - IMAGELIB">recent thread on describing visual materials</a> from the <a href="http://listserv.arizona.edu/archives/imagelib.html" title="Archives of IMAGELIB@LISTSERV.ARIZONA.EDU">IMAGELIB mailing list</a> sparked the descovery of these resources.</p>
<p>First was this bibliography of thesauri-related materials by <a href="mailto:L.Will@willpowerinfo.co.uk">Leonard Will</a> of <a href="http://www.willpowerinfo.co.uk/" title="Willpower Information: information management consultants">Willpower Information</a>, an information management consultant in the U.K.  It looks like a really good synopsis, and will be useful when adding controlled vocabularies to the DRC through <span class="removed_link" title="http://drc-dev.ohiolink.edu/wiki/MetaBuddy">MetaBuddy</span> and other tools.</p>
<blockquote>
<h1>Publications on thesaurus construction and use</h1>
<h2>- including some references to facet analysis, taxonomies, ontologies, topic maps and related issues</h2>
<p>This is a list of printed and electronic publications about the principles of constructing and using information retrieval thesauri. It is not a list of existing thesauri, although some thesauri have been included when they are good examples or illustrate the results of different approaches to thesaurus construction.</p>
<p>At the end I have given a few references on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.willpowerinfo.co.uk/thesbibl.htm#facets" title="http://www.willpowerinfo.co.uk/thesbibl.htm#facets">facet analysis</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.willpowerinfo.co.uk/thesbibl.htm#interfaces" title="http://www.willpowerinfo.co.uk/thesbibl.htm#interfaces">search interfaces</a> that provide for thesaurus use by combining terms from multiple facets, or multiple characteristics of division within a facet</li>
<li><a href="http://www.willpowerinfo.co.uk/thesbibl.htm#lists" title="http://www.willpowerinfo.co.uk/thesbibl.htm#lists">lists of thesauri</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.willpowerinfo.co.uk/thesbibl.htm#taxonomies" title="http://www.willpowerinfo.co.uk/thesbibl.htm#taxonomies">taxonomies</a>, the currently fashionable term for classification schemes</li>
<li><a href="http://www.willpowerinfo.co.uk/thesbibl.htm#ontologies" title="http://www.willpowerinfo.co.uk/thesbibl.htm#ontologies">ontologies</a>, which appear to be a developments of a thesaurus, with a greater number of kinds of relationship between concepts, intended to be useful to software implementing aspects of the proposed "semantic web"</li>
<li><a href="http://www.willpowerinfo.co.uk/thesbibl.htm#topicmaps" title="http://www.willpowerinfo.co.uk/thesbibl.htm#topicmaps">topic maps</a>, which are a way of structuring such an ontology, with the addition of links between concepts and information resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have not yet examined all the articles listed, so in some cases the details and abstracts quoted have come from current awareness services and other sources.</p>
