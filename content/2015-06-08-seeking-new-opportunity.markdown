<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>Know of someone looking for a skilled library technologist?  The funding for my position at LYRASIS will run out at the end of June, and I am looking for a new opportunity for my skills in library technology, open source, and community engagement.  <a href="https://dltj.org/resume/">My resume/<i>c.v.</i></a> is online, and I welcome any information about potential positions.</p>
<p>Over the course of my career I have worked in a variety of library environments ranging from medium- and large-sized academic institutions to a professional graduate school. Most recently I have worked for two consortia of academic libraries and a broad spectrum of archives and museums. I have used my skills to write local custom code when needed, adapt open source systems when possible, and contribute code to open source projects when able.  I have also led teams to deploy open source software for cultural heritage organizations (<a href="/article/setting-the-right-environment/">most recently at LYRASIS</a>).  My professional activities include leading the Innovative Interfaces Users group, contributing to the development of the W3C&rsquo;s Library Linked Data Incubator Group report, participating in NISO committees (Discovery to Delivery Topic Committee, Publications Committee, and NISO/OAI ResourceSync Protocol Working Group), and communing with fellow Code4Lib library technologists.</p>
<p>I place a high value on the development of relationships between organizations and professionals.  At LYRASIS I was the principal investigator on an Andrew W. Mellon-funded project to identify and promote sustainable practices in open source software development, which culminated in two symposia: one invitational face-to-face and one that was open to a worldwide audience.  I have also worked to build community consensus, particularly with several key OhioLINK consortium strategic initiatives such as research on e-textbook development and licensing, and leading a task force on a discovery system.</p>
<p>If these skills would be valuable to your organization or if you know of a position where I can use this experience, please e-mail me at <a href="mailto:jester@dltj.org">jester@dltj.org</a>.</p>
