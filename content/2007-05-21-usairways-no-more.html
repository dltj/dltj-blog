  content: "This exact same thing happened to me this past weekend. Well, sort of.
    It was a cancelled flight and even though my future husband and I had a confirmation
    #, ticket #, and seat #'s we were surprised that we were flying STANDBY for our
    entire trip. I ended up not taking any of my original flights and missing a day
    of work because USAIRWAYS are OVERBOOKING AND OVERSELLING their flights.\r\n\r\nPlus,
    like you I have been given every number under the sun for USAir. \r\n\r\nHere's
    what I have:\r\n\r\n866-523-5333 (message tells you to call Phoenix, because of
    the merger) \r\n480-693-6735 (which tells you to call the 866#) \r\n800-428-4322
    \r\n800-363-2542 \r\n800-235-9292 \r\n800-428-4322 \r\n800-327-7810\r\n\r\nI too
    will think very carefully before ever flying with this airline again."

    and overbooking flights is par for the course</span> in the airline industry.  I
    can't really fault them -- they have huge simulations and vast amounts of data
    that they mine in an attempt to fill each and every seat on a flight.  That does
    mean overbooking flights, but it is their choice and they should step up immediately
    to do the responsible thing when their computer programs guess wrong.<p style="padding:0;margin:0;font-style:italic;"

    complain because US Airways doesn&rsquo;t even have a real person answer when
    you call! The Imperial Palace is an awful hotel with a shortage of elevators,
    dated rooms, uncomfortable mattresses, no amenities, no concierge, and an overpriced
    buffet. But other than that it was just fine <!--%kramer-post%-->"

  content: I have a similar story...going greece from america.  They held the plane
    20 min for 1 man at my originating location...put me and my group of 23 late for
    our next flight we arrived as the plane was departing (we were told it was being
    held for us). 4 hours later after every person that worked for usair had turned
    their badges around so we couldn't see their names we had a plan to get over seas.  this
    was going to get us in 20 hours later than we had planned &amp; 4 hours before
    our cruise ship was going to leave.  We missed tours, hotel accomidations and
    dinner that was already paid for.  note that 15 minutes after seeing our flight
    was gone we had another route that could accomidate all 23 of us and we would
    get in 2 hours later than the original schedule...but that would mean usair had
    to give up our tickets to luftsana which they didn't want to do.  so we traveled
    18 unnessesary hours.  any so we board our over seas flight in pittsburg but it
    was delayed 4 hours b/c of rain.  so we sat on the airplane and watched our luggage
    get soaked outside.  why a usair person couldn't put it in the plane I am not
    sure.  so 3 days after we arrived in greece our clothes dried out.  it was just
    one thing after another.  then the customer service is worthless!! I give up on
    flying usair.

  content: "I had a similar hell-scenario happen today. Here's the rundown:\r\n\r\n-Arrived
    at San Francisco International at 5:30am for a 7am flight to Philadelphia, which
    was to connect to Paris.\r\n-Was told that our flight had been canceled --> no
    reason given (some people said mechanical, some said weather)\r\n-I checked the
    weather for Philadelphia on my internet phone...it said it was \"partly cloudy\"
    in Philadelphia\r\n-Waited in a line from 5:45am until 2pm. Only ONCE did a US
    Airways worker walk past the line, and all they said was \"We're sorry for the
    delay...we're working on it\"...No explanation as to why this was happening or
    what the solution was.\r\n-Called the 1-800 number, got dropped about 5 times
    before getting through. I was told that the earliest flight would be 3 days later.\r\n-FINALLY
    got to the counter and luckily the lady was actually able to get us on a flight
    the next day.\r\n-I did hear horror stories about people who missed their flight
    one day, rescheduled, and then came to the airport the next day only to find that
    their names really weren't on the list.\r\n\r\nIn short...I'M NEVER FLYING U.S.
    AIRWAYS AGAIN after this flight."

  content: I booked a flight for my friend who came to visit from Africa. Keep in
    mind he's only been in the country for 5days. It was pretty short timing so I
    got him on a US-Airways flight from Baltimore to PHL, then from there to CHicago.
    He was supposed to get here on friday night so we could attend a paid event on
    saturday. Well his flight from Philadelpia got cancelled because of some weather
    system in Boston ... He was supposed to take off at 8:30pm friday night ... we
    didn't find out the flight was cancelled till 2:30amEST saturday morning. Then
    the whole standby run around. It's 9:30 saturday morning and he's already missed
    the first flight out (overbooked).... so now we wait. Looks like money wasted
    to me ... It gets very frustrating trying to get a definite answer from those
    rude customer service folks at US Airways... Please no matter where you're going
    if US Airways becomes an option seriously think about driving .. I hate to say
    this but now I believe the greyhound bus will probably even get you there on time!!!

  content: "It happened to me too, but I have good news. My flight got canceled due
    to a storm, and immediately asked for a refund, but customer service was retarded.
    I called the number for refund, no person. I emailed, got a response saying that
    it would take up to 60 to 90 days for a refund. Before 90 days were up, I sent
    them a second email saying that I will contact the Better Business Bureau if they
    do not reply by the 90 days is up, they reply saying they would contact me within
    30 days. I was like, screw that, they're just playing with me. So a few days after
    the 90 days were up, I went online to the BBB and filed a complaint. (In a class,
    my professor read us an article how BBB can actually be useful to you, and how
    the author of the article got her money back through the BBB, so I had some hope)
    \r\nAbout a week and a half later (today) I got a response from the BBB, saying
    that US Airways have responded. A woman from the corporate office responded saying
    that my money will be refunded in 7 to 10 days. In addition for compensation,
    I will get a $400 electronic travel voucher(!!!) I really didn't see that coming,
    as I only asked for a refund of my ticket. While I am still skeptical about US
    Airways, I now can travel for free for Thanksgiving...which is really awesome
    for me since my boyfriend and I were not sure if we could travel for thanksgiving
    or not...we're poor college kids.\r\n\r\nWell my point is, try BBB to solve your
    miseries, it actually works and really it's not a whole lot of work. It's pretty
    easy."

  content: It is uncanny how the experiences in this article and the bits and pieces
    of comments above recall to fine detail what my hisband and I just experienced
    on a flight from Ireland to DC (via Philly). Needless to say, we never flew our
    return leg from Philly to DC--we rented a car and the rest of the story is given
    above in the experiences already described by others -- the numerous phone number/roundtrip
    dialing runaround, literally hours on hold, and clueless, demoralized US Airways
    staff, etc. One stewardess had the nerve to snap at a customer on our 3 hour delayed
    flight from Ireland (only the beginning as US Air never actually got us home)
    that she "was in the same boat." It is clear that this company's operating policy
    is to overbook significantly (by 20% according to the words of same stewardess,
    said freely on the plane for all passengers to hear); to cancel liberally; and
    to fail to refund the vast majority of customers for cancelled flights never taken.
    Better Business Bureau here I come...

  content: "US Airways is just awful.  On August 9 I was supposed to be flying from
    O'hare to Philadelphia, all the flights for the evening were canceled, supposedly
    due to weather in the NE (though both my colleagues were able to get to NY laguardia
    just fine).  So I waited in line for nearly two hours, only to have a US Airways
    rep announce that all those in line would not be able to fly out until Saturday
    (2 days away) on US Airways or any other airline.\r\n\r\nWhich was, of course,
    total BS.  I left the line and found a flight the next day on United. Right this
    minute I'm trying to get a refund for the canceled US Airways flight, I've been
    transferred once and have now been on hold for about 30 minutes. \r\n\r\nI can't
    wait for US Airways to finally close shop, and allow another airline to take over
    \ their space in the Philadelphia airport.  I could tell you other stories (for
    example, a ticket agent in Philadelphia dropped my husband's drivers license behind
    the ticket counter, and told him that he could not reach it.  When my husband
    understandably got upset, the supervisor told him that they couldn't possibly
    have maintenance take apart that section of the counter, just for his driver's
    license. But no worries, because they would make sure he would be able to get
    on his outgoing flight (how he would rent a car or fly home was out of their hands).
    \ \r\n\r\nUS Airways sucks.  And I'm still on hold."

  content: "Wow, Ray -- that was such a thoughtful and coherent response that I hardly
    know where to begin.  Let's start with the fact that I paid US Airways a reasonable
    sum of money to transport me and my belongings from point a to point b with care
    and speed.  That's their job.  Failing that, reasonable accommodations should
    be offered with grace and humility.  That's good customer service.  Failing that,
    refund that reasonable sum of money along with compensation for failing to meet
    their end of the transaction (a night's hotel and a one-way car rental, in my
    case).  That's what a company that cares about its customers <em>and</em> its
    bottom line would do.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I did get a piece of the last of the
    three -- a refund for the unused portion of the ticket.  It took a great deal
    of persistence and patience though...more than I think is appropriate for the
    circumstances.  As echoed here and elsewhere, many are in the same boat."

    I think that Ray may have certain point about getting too used to
    technology. There may be another blog for that conversation. I also
    think that my ancestors got just as mad at ripoff artists along the
    Conestoga trails. There historically are good and bad people and
    organizations in the world. I think USAir may be inherently bad,
    but more so, they are inherently inept and need to rethink their
    entire approach to business. How can Southwest do so well,as USAir
    flounders? I think that a lot of it has to do with applying humor
    and candid truth to the operation. USAir lacks that, read my letter
    to them: Dear ****, I hope you took my advice as friendly
    information. Keep that resume polished up. I really think that
    USAir is going down. Look, we don't need lawyers to settle this. I
    just want my money's worth. So far all you have done for me is get
    my son to his college orientation 18 hours late. No, this isn't the
    end of the world, but I had a payment for a $*** session for him
    that he was very late for. So, you really owe me more. You need to
    call me and clarify this offer, or I will be working with
    MASTERCARD to reverse these charges before the day ends. Are you
    saying that I have to pay you $100 because you cancelled a flight
    with 5 minutes to go before boarding? There was never a plane
    there. This is a scam. You know that the system cannot book the
    number of passengers you have and you keep the proceeds. So, give
    me a call at ***-***-****. We actually DO have connections with
    U.S. Congressman on the Aviation Subcommittee of the House
    Committee on Transportation. They actually were impacted by this
    too and we are comparing notes on how you handle these
    reimbursements. Look, there are real people on this end affected by
    your airlines ineptitude. You cannot get away with this for long.
    While the stock market has soared, USAir's stock has dropped from
    over $60 a share in Jan. '07 to less than $30 today. Perhaps if you
    acted in a more responsible fashion to your customers this would
    not be happening. You might even get a raise if you start calling,
    what must be hundreds of, all the disgruntled customers that you
    have out there and actually explain what went wrong and why. Then
    you might get a customer base that begins to understand the limits
    and complexities of your service and is able to plan around them.
    For instance, if I had know that my son would likely not make his
    appointment on Sept. 1, I may have had him fly the day before. That
    way we all would be happy. Look, I think you have a moral
    responsibility here....at least you PERSONALLY do. You will feel
    better if you call me and clarify exactly how I can get my money
    back or be sastified. I think you are Phoenix, so I will extend my
    deadline to Friday morning before I called my Master Platinum
    Service Center and get my money back. Thank you for you keen
    attention to this email, me (I don't really expect a
    response....but I feel better)

    to most locations, then USAir is the only game in town, and they know it and make
    us pay more for flights than anywhere else in NC, and most of the US.\r\n\r\nI
    wanted to fly myself, the wife and child to Florida in late September.  Over $800
    for each of us, $2400+ in total.  I could drive to Greenville and fly back to
    Charlotte, and jump on the same plane, and it'd only cost me about $250 each.
    \ Ridiculous, but when your traveling with a young, energetic child, anything
    but the fastest / shortest trip makes little sense.  So $2400 it was.\r\n\r\nOne
    month later, and the ticket was $260.  Calling reservations was useless, the woman
    just kept saying 'non-refundable ticket'.  I'd gotten a minimum wage sales drone,
    the kind that isn't going to do anything for you short of elevating your blood
    pressure and forget about trying to find a contact number for anybody on their
    website.\r\n\r\nHowever, I found the US Airways customer relations number (1-480-693-2341)
    in the comments above, and a very nice gentlemen there, who answered the phone
    with no delay, was able to find my information and get me over to a person in
    reservations, both of who spoke excellent English, and they helped me get vouchers
    for the difference.\r\n\r\nI don't claim that USAirways is great or anything,
    the stranglehold they have on the Charlotte market makes for some annoyingly expensive
    flights, and their penchant for small planes crammed to the gills isn't fun, but
    they did on this occasion get me some satisfaction and for that I greatly appreciate
    it."

    crew on the LAX-PHL flight (which was operated by US Airways) was a joke.  They
    decided to board the flight 15 minutes prior to our scheduled departure time.
    \ The flight crew knew 1 hour prior that there were 3 persons in wheelchairs that
    needed assistance getting on the flight. (Which begs the question why board the
    entire flight 15 minutes prior to the scheduled departure time.) Then, as people
    were still boarding, the pilot gets on the mic and asks people to hurry up and
    have a seat so they are not late with the departure. <-- The entrance to the plane
    was stil ajar, people were not only still putting their carry on\\'s away, but
    people were still boarding.\r\n\r\nEventually people were peeved enough and just
    plopped their rear ends down. Then the flight crew appears. These people looked
    like the derelicts of flight attendance school drop outs. You would think they
    just woke up after long night of heavy drinking. When I asked one of the flight
    attendants for a pillow, because I had just seen her handing them out, she gave
    me this look of death and said \\'I only have blankets.\\'  Not \\\"oh! I\\'m
    sorry but we just ran out\\\". Whatever! The entire flight crew when speaking
    on the mic or answering a question answered as if  THEY were doing US a favor.
    I kept thinking \\'if it were not for us paying customers, YOU would not have
    a job.\\'\r\n\r\nThe flight from PHL-CHS was much much better. Sad to say but
    they are much more hospitable and kind. US Airways should send their attendants
    to get some on the job training w/ those that operate commuter flights for them."

  content: Last October I purchased a ticket from US Airways. When the sales agent
    read me the itinerary - I caught a mistake.  She said she would have to start
    again to fix the error so I told her to just cancel the ticket and I would buy
    my flights on line - which I did. Then I got my statement and saw that I had been
    charged for the tickets I purchased on line and the cancelled ticket.  I called
    and the cancelled ticket did not come up in the system - because it was cancelled.  I
    was put on hold for 65 minutes when I called customer service.  I called customer
    service every day for a week.  No luck. So I went to my credit card company to
    see if they could help.  They agreed my claim was valid but even they could not
    get satisfaction from US Airways so now I'm back to trying to get it from them
    myself.  I will never travel on US Airways again, ever.

    is AWFUL.  Now I will admit I sort of put the inconvenience on myself but they
    did not make my experience with them a pleasant one at all.\r\n\r\nI book a flight
    to leave out of Tallahassee on a sunday but decided to road trip to Myrtle beach
    and thought that i would cancel my flight and book a new flight with them from
    Myrtle beach to Boston and boy was that a DISASTER.\r\n\r\nThey're refund policy
    is BULL. instead of taking a hit and canceling it for a fee you just can't do
    that you have a year to re-use but you have to pay an addition 150?!?! So I decided
    whatever I still needed a ticket. I called 4-5 different times to ask questions
    and to book my reservation and not ONE person spoke English as their FIRST language
    which might I add really screwed me! The lady could not understand me and asked
    me to repeat all of  my information ATLEAST a half a dozen times. After about
    45 minutes on the phone I get cut off. Now this woman asked me for my number a
    bunch a times you'd think she would call back. No so i assumed she would call
    back instead just booked my ticked but I didn't have any of my confirmation information
    so I called someone at home and they booked my ticked on Orbitz that it took all
    of 5 minutes. I get to the airport and i was charged twice for the same flight.
    \ UGH!\r\n\r\nNone the less i put my frustration aside and decided to deal with
    the refund fiasco for when i got home. I get on the flight and the the stewardess'
    were UNBELIEVABLY rude. Same as they were on my way down to Florida. By this point
    I wanted to BURST.\r\n\r\nBecause of this ordeal I will NEVER fly U.S. Airways
    ever again. Jet Blue is my Airline of choice and I am more than willing to spend
    a little extra to avoid all of the hassle."

  content: "I booked a direct flight with US air from Baltimore to Phoenix two months
    before I was supposed to leave.  I showed up on the morning of my flight only
    to find that the flight had been canceled due to mechanical reasons.  Nobody's
    fault there, I assume.  I was offered a flight the next morning but needed to
    get there ASAP so US Air changed my 5 hour direct flight to a 15 hour byzantine
    roundelay of connections through four airports -- but I made it!\r\n\r\nThe flight
    back was more complicated; they overbooked, I was involuntarily bumped.  The US
    Air agent Amy Bullard, Employee # S17482 was obnoxious and rude in just about
    every way possible.  It was plainly obvious that she did NOT care about my predicament.
    \ She offered me a flight the next morning which was no good; I had to be at work
    then.  Southwest Airlines had a flight going out in a couple of hours -- which
    I would have to buy at the gate -- for $500!  Amy Bullard refused to pay for it.
    \ All I got was a refund for my ticked ($183) which I could apply to my new $500
    ticket.  It was Easter Sunday, Amy refused to let me talk to a supervisor (she
    said she was the highest ranking supervisor there) and I had NO CHOICE but to
    accept the refund or wait until tomorrow.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived to Baltimore,
    my back was in lockup and all of the US air employees were gone for the day.  When
    I called the next morning, to had my bag delivered, I was told by customer service
    (in India) that all claims for bags had to be made in person and that I would
    have to drive back to the airport (1 hour each way).  I did, and whatever frozen
    food I had in the bag went bad by then.  \r\n\r\nNOW HERE IS SOME ADVICE: I paid
    for a direct flight both ways and US Air did not provide those services.  After
    speaking to an attorney/friend I was told the following:  \r\n\r\n1) US Air failed
    to fulfill their end of the deal by providing me a direct flight in either direction.
    \ \r\n\r\n2) Although accommodations were provided, those accommodations were
    NOT reasonable.  \r\n\r\nI called my credit card company (AMEX) and asked them
    to reverse the charges.  We'll see how that works.  I'm determined not to pay
    for crap service and rudeness!!!  I have no idea if it is going to work, but its
    worth a shot."

  content: "My turn to pile on.  I booked a flight for Greenville, NC on 10/30 (at
    3 am) for a Christmas eve flight to Greenville, SC.  Or so I thought.  The same
    morning at 8 am, I double-checked my itinerary and noticed a mistake-- I selected
    Greenville, NC by mistake.  Four hours away, but I was confident the mistake was
    caught early enough-- heck, the plane was 90% empty when I booked.\r\n\r\nThe
    first customer service representative was very unsympathetic to my dyslexic problem
    and told me I would have to pay the $150 change fee.  Obviously perturbed, I decided
    to call back later once the blood returned to my extremities.\r\n\r\nAround noon,
    I tried again and got a much better response.  I was now told that company policy
    is to make these changes WITHOUT the $150 change fee if caught within 24 hours
    of booking.  \"Whew\", I thought.  Crummy that policies like that depend on who
    you talk to, but it all worked out...or so I thought.\r\n\r\nDecember 15th, and
    I go back to double-check my itinerary.  \"What's this\", I said as I noticed
    I was still headed to...you guessed it, Greenville NORTH CAROLINA.\r\n\r\nI called
    customer service (in the Phillipines) and was mysteriously disconnected four separate
    times (on a land line no less).  But unfortunately for me, there was no record
    of my flight change request on 10/30...so I was SOL.  Plus, each time I spoke
    to customer service, I got a different story on the policy about the $150 change
    fee.  To make things worse, I was definitely going to be charged the difference
    between the flight I booked on 10/30 and the flights available now-- to the tune
    of $308.  Did it matter that they were negligent in fulfilling the change request?
    \ Nope.  According to the grand wizard of supervisors (everyone seems to be a
    supervisor at US Airways customer service, though no one has the power to fix
    anything) it was my fault for not verifying the change was made within 24 hours.
    \ My bad!  I guess I should also be ready hop in the cockpit if the crew decides
    to nap, or carry my paddle and water wings in case they decide to splash-land
    in the Hudson again.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I will be driving to my destination
    on Christmas Eve this year.  Thanks again for remembering the importance of customer
    service and reliability US Airways!\r\n\r\nBTW, I later found out that there was
    a flight to Asheville, NC for $400 total, but no one mentioned that in the 3 hours
    I spent on the phone trying to straighten out this mess."

  content: I appreciate all of the comments here, particularly right after my trip
    to get a sense that I wasn't alone.  <acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology
    Jester"><i>DLTJ</i></acronym>, though, isn't a forum for consumer complains or
    news about airlines in general or U.S. Airways in particular.  I'm closing comments
    on this post.  For me, U.S. Airways has not yet had an opportunity to win back
    my business, but I certainly hope they have improved since the last time I used
    their services.
---
<p>I will never fly <a href="http://usairways.com/" title="http://usairways.com/">U.S. Airways</a> again, if I have a choice.  A competing airline's ticket is going to have to be substantially more expensive for me to even consider U.S. Airways as an alternative.</p>
<p>This all started with a trip to Ithaca two months ago.  There was a substantial weather system that move through the eastern seaboard area that screwed up traffic for a number of carriers.  From my vantage point on the ground &mdash; watching the FAA's <a href="http://www.fly.faa.gov/ois/jsp/summary_sys.jsp" title="Summary">National Airspace System Status Summary</a> as well as various <a href="http://www.fboweb.com/fb40/default.aspx" title="Flight tracking, online flight planning and services.  fboweb.com - "Total Aviation Awareness"">flight</a> <a href="http://www.flightstats.com/go/Home/home.do" title="Track Flight Status, Airport Delays and other Flight and Airport Information">tracking</a> <a href="http://flightaware.com/" title="FlightAware - Free Flight Tracker - IFR Flight Status, Tracking, History, Maps">services</a> &mdash; everything seemed to be on time for a flight from Syracuse through Washington-Regan to Columbus.  Washington-Regan was spared the brunt of the storm and was not having to de-ice aircraft, as I recall.  Other major airports had closed various runways and were reducing traffic with ground-stop programs, but as the afternoon wore on the system was improving.  The only abnormality was an odd message on the National Airspace System Status Summary was a message that the Philadelphia airport was closed to U.S. Airways traffic at the request of the airline due to "lack of ramp space."  The U.S. Airways website continued to show an on-time departure, so I figured the aircraft for my flight from Syracuse to Washington-Regan was <em>coming</em> from Washington-Regan or somewhere else that was not affected by the Philadelphia airline-requested ground stop.  I headed to the Syracuse airport...</p>
<p>...where I found all hell had broken loose.  In the 75 minutes it took me to drive from Ithaca to Syracuse, U.S. Airways canceled what looked to be all of their operations in the northeast.  Based on past travel experience, I've found that it is often better to call the airline's central toll-free number rather than wait in a customer service line at the airport.  Wrong choice.  U.S. Airways' phone system had basically melted down.  It took 23 dialing attempts just to get in the queue of people "waiting for the next available agent" and after 90 minutes on hold I hung up and got in line.  The guy that got in line behind me said he held on the phone for five hours at his house before hanging up and driving to the airport, thinking that the service had to be better than that at the airport.  Right?</p>
<p>Wrong.  An hour and a half later plus two television reporters on a remote for the evening news talking about the long lines of customers in front of the U.S. Airways ticket counter at the Syracuse Airport, I finally got to the head of the line.  The best the agent could offer was a flight 49 hours later.  I asked about compensation based on the problems in Philadelphia.  She said the problem was the FAA closing airports due to the weather.  I told her about the message from the FAA's status page about the problem only affecting U.S. Airways flights in Philadelphia.  She told me she knew nothing about it, but that if I wasn't on the flight 49 hours later that I could apply for a refund for the unused portion of the ticket.</p>
<p>So I rented a car and booked a hotel room for the night (neither of which U.S. Airways would pay for).  After a good nights sleep I drove home and picked up my car from the airport parking lot 27 hours before any possibility that U.S. Airways could get me there.  </p>
<p>In the middle of the following week, I submitted my request for a refund via some automated automated telephone system that no longer exists (800-363-2542 -- it now gets routed to the "customer relations system" at 866-523-5333, but more on that in a minute).  A week later I called a separate number (480-693-6735, as documented on the <a href="http://www.usairways.com/awa/content/contact/refund_info.aspx" title="US Airways | Refund Inquiry">U.S. Airways Ticket Refund</a> website) and keyed my ticket number into the automated system; it wasn't found.  So I faxed a copy of everything to the number suggested (800-892-3447).  A week later I checked the automated system; nothing.  So I sent a copy in the mail to the 4000 East Sky Harbor, Pheonix, AZ address.  I just checked the automated system again; nothing.</p>
<p>So I've had it with the automated systems and I try to get someone on the line.  I call the "Customer Relations" number (866-523-5333); option #2 is for ticket refunds and such.  The recorded message tells me that to serve me better I should hang up and dial a 480-693-6735.  Yes, if you're keeping track, we've seen that number before.  It is the automated check-the-status-of-your-request number.  The voice prompts don't give you a way to talk to a human, but after hitting enough garbage into the system you get routed to what the system claims to be is the queue of people waiting for the next available agent.  I only spend 25 minutes on hold here before giving up -- it's my dime paying for the call, after all.  Next I call the central number for U.S. Airways where an agent gives me all of the phone numbers I've already tried and says that is all she can do for me.</p>
<p>Here's the real kicker -- U.S. Airways is acting like it doesn't care what you think.  As a last resort, I call the "Customer Relations" number once more and pick option #3 -- for a "complement or concern" -- and after a few rings I am offered an apology for not being "personally available to take your call now..." (no queue of people on this option).  Boy, it is a good thing I didn't have a complement for the airline, right?</p>
<p>Now, I never expected it to be <em>easy</em> to get a refund for my ticket (it is, after all, money that they would want to keep for not doing any real work), but I do expect it to be <em>possible</em>.  So, U.S. Airways, as your pilots say when we land, I <em>do</em> have an option in air carriers when I fly, and from now on I won't be choosing U.S. Airways.</p>
<p>Update (20070601T0956):  The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/30/business/30bump.html?ex=1338350400&#038;en=63e8f50cdd4ff685&#038;ei=5124&#038;partner=permalink&#038;exprod=permalink" title="Article: &#039;Bumped Fliers and No Plan B&#039;">New York Times has an article about the overbooking practice by airlines</a>, focusing on U.S. Airways.  A part:  "Overbooking is one of many airline practices that are complicated by crowded planes. Airlines are running closer to capacity than at any point during the jet age &mdash; an expected 85 percent or so full this summer, which means all the seats on popular routes will be taken."</p>
