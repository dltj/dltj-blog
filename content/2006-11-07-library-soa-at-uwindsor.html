<p>It is my honor and pleasure to be asked to speak at a one-day symposium called "<span class="removed_link" title="http://infoservices.uwindsor.ca/ils/">The Future of the Integrated Library System</span>" hosted by the University of Windsor on November 15, 2006.  More information can be found at <span class="removed_link" title="http://infoservices.uwindsor.ca/ils/">the symposium wiki</span>.  I have a one-hour talk with the title "Could We Do What They Are Doing?  Applying the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) Model to Libraries" that will build on the <a href="/tag/librarysoa/" title="Postings in DLTJ on Library SOA">library-oriented SOA postings</a> and comments made here last month.  (And I do intend to get back to the series &mdash; after all, I need to draft a whitepaper for the OhioLINK Technical Advisory Council to write on that same topic as well!)</p>
<p>Two things brought this to mind today.  First, a colleague from Miami U asked if he could get a copy of the presentation slides and notes ("Sure, as soon as they are done!").  Second, an odd oversized envelope arrived with an IBM return address in today's mail.  Inside was a "IBM Limited Edition" excerpt of <a href="http://www.dummies.com/go/soafordummies" title="Dummies::Service Oriented Architecture For Dummies:Book Information">"Service Oriented Architecture For Dummies"</a>.  I'm not quite sure what I did in this life or a past one to have received a nicely condensed goldmine of information, but based on the contents of this 66-page abridged edition I'll be making an investment in the full 350-some-odd page version.  (Perhaps I just answered my own question about how it arrived on my doorstep &mdash; it is an effective marketing ploy.  For any other marketers out there, I would be interested in a complementary reduced edition of an Apple iPod &mdash; perhaps you can win me over with a Nano or Shuffle... <code>:-)</code> ).
