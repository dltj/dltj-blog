As the last <i><acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester">DLTJ</acronym> Thursday Threads</i> of the year, the stories in this post look back to what we saw in 2011 and look forward to what we may see in 2012.  Looking backwards is a list of <a href="#p3560-publishing">five things we learned about publishing</a> from O'Reilly Media and <a href="#p3560-zeitgeist">Google's 3-minute Zeitgeist video</a>.  Looking forward are a list of predictions <a href="#p3560-tech">from Fast Company</a> and <a href="#p3560-nesta">from the National Endowment for Science Technology and the Arts</a> in the UK.  At this high point when 2011 is slowing and we start down the hill of 2012, I wish you a happy and prosperous new year.

I think we can add a sixth thing: The relationship between libraries and publishers is no longer a passive one.  Although libraries and publishers were always intertwined, this year we saw more stories where they came head-to-head (<a href="/article/thursday-threads-2011w9/#hcod">HarperCollins/OverDrive</a> and <a href="/article/thursday-threads-2011w37/#p3398-hathi-trust">Authors Guild versus HathiTrust</a>) and side-by-side (<a href="/article/thursday-threads-2011w21/#p2906-cipa-dcl">Douglas County's Ebook Lending</a>).  I expect we will see this trend continue in 2012.

A couple things for libraries to watch in this list.  I don't know if eBooks will dominate, but they will certainly become more prevalent.  The first quarter 2012 sales for ebooks will be interesting because many people are expecting a bump in sales that corresponds with e-reader gifts.  (Helped, no doubt, by the introduction of the new Kindle models late in the year.)  Look for libraries to publish statistics of lending as well, although one wonders how much "head room" is left in the lendable collections after the last surge of e-reader sales.  Given that budgets in libraries -- and the cities/states/universities over them -- tend to lag the business world, I'm not sure that IT spending in libraries will increase although there is some infrastructure that really needs to be updated.  And personally I think libraries should punt on the whole Android versus iOS debate and design for a mobile, HTML5-based world.

This list comes from the National Endowment for Science Technology and the Arts in the U.K., so I think some of the predictions are specific to that country (the mobile wallet prediction, in particular), but I believe most of these are pretty general for the U.S. as well.
