Inspired by Tom Whitwell's [52 things I learned in 2022](https://medium.com/magnetic/52-things-i-learned-in-2022-db5fcd4aea6e), I started my own list of [things I learned in 2023]({filename}/2024-01-18-one-year-of-learning-2023) and [repeated it last year]({filename}/2024-12-14-one-year-of-learning-2024). 
Reaching the end of another year, it is time for _Things I Learned In 2025._ Part way through the year I had the brilliant idea of putting a learning at the bottom of [my weekly newsletter](/category/thursday-threads/), and that worked well until the middle of the year when I stopped publishing newsletter issues. So here is a _half year_ of learnings.

What did you learn this year? 
Let me know on [Mastodon](https://code4lib.social/@dltj/) or [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/dltj.org/).

So 7:00 a.m. in East Africa Time, Ethiopia&apos;s time zone, is 1:00 in daylight hours in local Ethiopian time. At 7:00 p.m., East Africa Time, Ethiopians start over again, so it&apos;s 1:00 on their 12-hour clock.',

Then 12 hours of night, numbered 1 through 12.

The guy who had called him into his office, Vannevar Bush, knew that by the end of the year, the US was going to drop an atomic bomb that had the potential to end the war, but also that as soon as it was dropped, everybody was going to want to know what is this weapon, how was it made, and so forth. Smyth accepted the assignment. It was published by Princeton University Press about a week after the bomb was dropped. It explained how the US made the bomb, but it told a very specific kind of story, the Oppenheimer story that you see in the movies, where a group of shaggy-haired physicists figured out how to split the atom and fission, and all of this stuff. The thing is, the physics of building an atomic bomb is, in some respects, the least important part. More important, if you actually want to make the thing explode, is the chemistry, the metallurgy, the engineering that were left out of the story.',

The quote above comes from the transcript of this podcast episode. 
I've thought about this a lot in the past week as the Trump administration's flood-the-zone strategy overwhelms the senses. 
In a valiant effort to cover everything that is news, I can't help but wonder about the lost perspective of what _isn't_ being covered. 
And I wonder where I can look to find that perspective.

The female offspring of the plant, called an embryosac, which you're probably less familiar with since they basically never leave home. They just stay inside flowers. Like again, they're not part of the flower. They are a separate plant living inside the flower. Once the pollen meets an embryosac, the pollen builds a tube to bridge the gap between them. Now it's time for the sperm. At this point, the pollen produces exactly two sperm cells, which it pipes over to the embryosac,
which in the meantime has produced an egg that the sperm can meet up with. Once fertilized, that egg develops into an embryo within the embryosac, hence the name, then a seed and then with luck a new plant. This one with two sets of DNA.",

## Most plastic in the ocean isn't from littering, and recycling will not save us {: #plastic}
{{ thursday_threads_quote(href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IglBJ62Sv3Q",
 blockquote="Littering is responsible for a very small percentage of the overall plastic in the environment. Based on this graph from the OECD, you can see littering is this teeny-tiny blue bar here, and mismanaged waste, not including littering, is this massive one at the bottom. Mismanaged waste includes all the things that end up either in illegal dump sites or burned in the open or in the rivers or oceans or wherever. The focus on littering specifically, it's an easy answer because obviously there's nothing wrong with discouraging people from littering, but it focuses on individual people's bad choices rather than systemic forces that are basically flushing plastic into the ocean every minute. Mismanaged waste includes everything that escapes formal waste systems. So they might end up dumped, they might end up burned, they might end up in the environment.

Contrary to popular belief, most plastic in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch stems from the fishing industry, with only a small fraction linked to consumer waste. 
The video highlights that mismanaged waste, rather than individual littering, is the primary contributor to plastic pollution, with 82% of macroplastic leakage resulting from this issue. 
It emphasizes the ineffectiveness of recycling as a solution, noting that less than 10% of plastics are currently recycled, and the industry has perpetuated the myth that recycling can resolve the plastic crisis. 
Microplastics, which are increasingly recognized as a major problem, originate from various sources, including tires and paint, with new data suggesting that paint is a significant contributor.

## "But where is everybody?!?" — the origins of Fermi's Paradox {: #fermi-paradox}

Otherwise, those alien craft would have never made it here. At first, Fermi boisterously participated in the conversation, offering his usual keen insights. But soon, he fell silent, withdrawing into his own ruminations. The conversation drifted to other subjects, but Fermi stayed quiet. Sometime later, long after the group had largely forgotten about the issue of UFOs, Fermi sat up and blurted out: “But where is everybody!?”',

This retelling of the Fermi Paradox coms from this story about why, despite the vastness of the universe, we have yet to encounter evidence of extraterrestrial civilizations. 
Enrico Fermi famously posed the question, "Where is everybody?" suggesting a disconnect between the expectation of abundant intelligent life and the lack of observable evidence. 
With this comes the Great Filter notion...proposing that there may be significant barriers preventing intelligent life from becoming spacefaring. 
The article goes on to speculate where we are relative to the "Great Filter" — are we past it, or is it yet in front of us?
In other words, have we survived the filter or is our biggest challenge ahead of us?

"scape" — "goat". 
Why do we say that? 
It comes from a phrase in the bible where a goat sent into the wilderness on the Day of Atonement as a symbolic bearer of the sins of the people — Leviticus 16:22, to be exact. 
The translator coined the term from the interpretation of "the goat that departs" and "emissary goat" in that verse.
