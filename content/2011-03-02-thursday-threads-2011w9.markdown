<p>It is an all e-books edition of <i><acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester">DLTJ</acronym> Thursday Threads</i> this week.  The biggest news was the <a href="#hcod">announcement of the policy change</a> by HarperCollins for ebooks distributed through OverDrive.  Beyond that, though, was an announcement of a <a href="#ia-ol-ill">new sharing model and program</a> through the Internet Archive.  Lastly is a slidecast recording of a presentation by David Lewis on the <a href="#collections-futures">future of library collections</a>.</p>
<p>Before continuing, a quick apology and explanation.  E-mail readers received a pair of extra Thursday Threads messages and RSS subscribers got a dump of unrelated posts; I'm sorry.  The cause was an update of this blog's WordPress software to <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2011/02/threeone/" title="WordPress 3.1, lots of fun">version 3.1</a> and a conflict (<a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-simple-tags-category-archive-wordpress-31" title="WordPress &#8250; Support &raquo; [Plugin: Simple Tags] Category Archive - WordPress 3.1">maybe this one</a>) with the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-tags/" title="WordPress &#8250; Simple Tags &laquo; WordPress Plugins">SimpleTags</a> plugin.  I believe all is well, but I won't know until this post is published.</p>

<h2 id="hcod">HarperCollins Puts 26 Loan Cap on Ebook Circulations</h2>
<blockquote><p>In the first significant revision to lending terms for  ebook circulation, HarperCollins has announced that new titles licensed from  library ebook vendors will be able to circulate only 26 times before the license  expires.<br />
Mention of the new terms was first made in a letter from  OverDrive CEO Steve Potash to customers yesterday. He wrote  [emphasis in original]:</p>
<blockquote><p>
[W]e have been required to  accept and accommodate new terms for eBook lending as <strong><em>established by certain  publishers</em>.</strong> Next week, OverDrive will communicate a licensing  change from a publisher that, while still operating under the one-copy/one-user  model, will include a checkout limit for each eBook licensed. Under this  publisher's requirement, for every new eBook licensed, the library (and the  OverDrive platform) will make the eBook available to one customer at a time  until the total number of permitted checkouts is  reached.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Though the letter leaves the publisher unnamed,  HarperCollins confirmed today  to <em>[Library Journal]</em> that it is the publisher referred  to.
</p></blockquote>
<p>In an odd one-two punch, this past week saw a disturbance in the status quo of e-book licensing.  The first punch came in the <a href="http://librarianbyday.net/localwp-content/uploads/2011/02/OverDrive-Library-Partner-Update-from-Steve-Potash-2-24-2011.pdf" title="Letter from Steve Potash of Overdrive">letter from OverDrive</a> [PDF] (part of which is quoted in the Library Journal article excerpted above).  The second in <a href="http://www.libraryjournal.com/lj/home/889452-264/harpercollins_puts_26_loan_cap.html.csp" title="HarperCollins Puts 26 Loan Cap on Ebook Circulations | Library Journal">that Library Journal article</a> when we learned that the publisher pushing for the change of terms is HarperCollins.  Since then it has been the source of a great deal of discussion by librarians and a few <a href="http://www.courtneymilan.com/ramblings/2011/02/25/on-eating-your-seed-corn/" title="On eating your seed corn | Courtney Milan&#8217;s Blog">authors</a>, much of it in the form of <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23hcod" title="#hcod - Twitter Search">tweets with the hash-tag "#hcod"</a> (short for HarperCollinsOverDrive).  Damage control comes in the form of open letters from <a href="http://overdriveblogs.com/library/2011/03/01/a-message-from-overdrive-on-harpercollins-new-ebook-licensing-terms/" title="A message from OverDrive on HarperCollins&#8217; new eBook licensing terms | OverDrive&#039;s Digital Library Blog">OverDrive</a> and <a href="http://harperlibrary.typepad.com/my_weblog/2011/03/open-letter-to-librarians.html" title="Open Letter to Librarians | Library Love Fest">HarperCollins</a>.

<p>As you can see, much has already been said about the issue, and since collection development is not my specialty, you probably shouldn't look to me for an informed opinion.  (If pressed, I will suggest that it is a perfectly reasonable collection development policy to not buy access to material with terms that are not in the library's and patron's best interest.)  Instead, there is so much oddness in this new policy that I find I can't put myself in HarperCollins' shoes.  First, using OverDrive as a proxy for announcing this policy change seems wrong (and, frankly, unfair to OverDrive).  Then as word spreads, you don't make your own announcement, but rather talk to a reporter from Library Journal.  Then as news spreads through the day, you send a <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/HarperCollins/status/41505956953067520" title="Tweet from HarperCollins">single tweet</a>.  In fact, you don't really publicly respond <a href="http://harperlibrary.typepad.com/my_weblog/2011/03/open-letter-to-librarians.html" title="Open Letter to Librarians | Library Love Fest">until five days after</a> the twitter universe and biblio-blogosphere have been talking about it.  And it is pretty much a non-engaging, public relations response.  (You do get credit, though, for allowing open comments on your blog post.  But some of that credit is taken back because you aren't using a company branded blog.  Really? A typepad.com blog?  One of the tenants of most information literacy courses I've seen is to look for the source of the information, and it requires extra effort to take this blog seriously because it isn't in the harpercollins.com domain space.)</p>
<p>If I were to guess, this seems like a trial balloon that was badly floated.  I certainly can't fault HarperCollins for trying something new in the ebook licensing world, but this one has fallen flat.</p>
<h2 id="ia-ol-ill">Internet Archive and Library Partners Develop Joint Collection of 80,000+ eBooks To Extend Traditional In-Library Lending Model</h2>
<blockquote><p>Today [February 22, 2011], a group of libraries led by the Internet Archive announced a new, cooperative <a href="http://openlibrary.org/borrow" title="Borrow Books (Open Library)">80,000+ eBook lending collection</a> of mostly 20th century books on OpenLibrary.org, a site where it&rsquo;s already possible to read over 1 million eBooks without restriction. During a library visit, patrons with an OpenLibrary.org account can borrow any of these lendable eBooks using laptops, reading devices or library computers. This new twist on the traditional lending model could increase eBook use and revenue for publishers. ...</p>
<p>Any OpenLibrary.org account holder can borrow up to 5 eBooks at a time, for up to 2 weeks. Books can only be borrowed by one person at a time. People can choose to borrow either an in-browser version (viewed using the Internet Archive&rsquo;s BookReader web application), or a PDF or ePub version, managed by the free Adobe Digital Editions software. ...</p>
<p>Publishers selling their eBooks to participating libraries include Cursor and OR Books. Books purchased will be lent to readers as well as being digitally preserved for the long-term. This continues the traditional relationship and services offered by publishers and libraries.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This press release from the <a href="http://www.archive.org/post/349420/in-library-ebook-lending-program-launched" title="Internet Archive and Library Partners Develop Joint Collection of 80,000+ eBooks To Extend Traditional In-Library Lending Model">Internet Archive</a> largely went unnoticed on the eve of the <a href="#hcod">#hcod</a> onslaught.  It was covered in the <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/collaboration-seeks-to-provide-easier-access-to-e-books/30054" title="Collaboration Seeks to Provide Easier Access to E-Books | The Chronicle of Higher Education Wired Campus blog">Chronicle of Higher Education's Wired Campus blog</a> and in <a href="http://www.libraryjournal.com/lj/home/889508-264/internet_archive_tests_new_ebook.html.csp" title="Internet Archive Tests New Ebook Lending Waters: In-Library, and License-Free | Library Journal">Library Journal</a>.  The latter has a few more helpful details: "IA founder Brewster Kahle and director Peter Brantley also told <em>LJ</em> that small independent publishers <a href="http://thinkcursor.com/" title="Cursor homepage">Cursor</a>, <a href="http://www.orbooks.com/" title="OR Books homepage">OR Books</a>, and <a href="http://www.smashwords.com/" title="Smashwords homepage">Smashwords</a> will donate ebooks license-free to the Open Library for lending to all Open Library members. With this venture, IA hopes to establish a "first-sale precedent" for e-lending, according to Brantley."  One must be from one of the <a href="http://openlibrary.org/libraries" title="Libraries (Open Library)">participating libraries</a> to check out books.  My experience with most Internet Archive efforts is that the initial announcement is very subtle and not picked up widely, then slowly grows to something substantial.  I expect this project will follow much the same path and will have a noticeable imprint on the profession in a few years.</p>

<p>So far in <i><acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester">DLTJ</acronym> Thursday Threads</i> I've intentionally avoided pointing to items inside this blog -- preferring to link to events, resources, and conversations elsewhere.  I'm going to make sort-of-an-exception in this case because what I'm ultimately pointing to is not my work.  It is a <a href="/article/collections-futures/">slidecast (recorded audio synchronized to slides) of David Lewis' presentation</a> at the <a href="http://www.oclc.org/research/events/2010-06-09a.htm" title="2010 RLG Partnership Annual Meeting Agenda">2010 Annual RLG Partnership Meeting</a>.  Starting with a foundation from John Hagel III, John Seely Brown and Lang Davison called the "<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20121030163509/http://www.johnhagel.com:80/shiftindex.pdf" title="Measuring the forces of long-term change: The 2009 Shift Index">Shift Index</a>" [PDF], Clay Shirky's &ldquo;<a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/clay_shirky_how_cellphones_twitter_facebook_can_make_history.html" title="Clay Shirky: How social media can make history | Video on TED.com">How Social Media Can Make History</a>&rdquo; TED Talk, and Clayton Christensen's disruptive innovation theories, David walks through the possibilities for three strategic issues facing academic libraries:  Complete the migration from print to electronic collections; Retire legacy print collections; and Migrate the focus of collections from purchasing materials to curating content.  The slidecast is about 75 minutes long and well worth the time as a thought-provoking view of what libraries should be doing to survive the next few decades.</p>
