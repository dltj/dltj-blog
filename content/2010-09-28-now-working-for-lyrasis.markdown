<p><a href="http://www.lyrasis.org/" title="http://www.lyrasis.org/"><img src="/assets/images/2010/09/lyrasis-logo.gif" alt="" title="LYRASIS Logo" width="239" height="43" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1688" style="margin: 0 0 1.5em 2em;" /></a>News of my joining Lyrasis has been officially reported (<a href="http://www.lyrasis.org/News/Press-Releases/~/media/Files/Lyrasis/News/Press%20Releases/2010/Tim%20Daniels%20and%20Peter%20Murray%20Lead%20LTS.ashx" title="Tim Daniels and Peter Murray Lead LTS">"Timothy Daniels and Peter Murray to Lead LYRASIS Technology Services"</a> [PDF]) so I can talk about it here now.  On September 10th I left <a href="http://www.ohiolink.edu/" title="OhioLINK Homepage" rel="homepage">OhioLINK</a> to join LYRASIS on September 13th as the assistant director for the newly emerging <a href="http://www.lyrasis.org/" title="LYRASIS homepage" rel="homepage">LYRASIS</a> Technology Services (LTS).  Along with Tim Daniels, I'll be forming a group to help members among the various open source and commercial software options works best for their situations, including options where LYRASIS can effectively and efficiently aggregate Software-as-a-Service hosting options.</p>
<p>On a personal note, one of the best parts about the position is that I will not have to move from central Ohio.  Given that <a href="http://www.librarytechnology.org/ltg-displaytext.pl?RC=14582" title="http://www.librarytechnology.org/ltg-displaytext.pl?RC=14582">LYRASIS comes from the merger of three other consortia</a> (PALINET, SOLINET, and NELINET) about 40% of staff are not in the LYRASIS home office in Atlanta.  The organization is making use of virtual office tools such as video Skype and SharePoint to stay connected.</p>
<p>This new position shouldn't impact the content of <i><acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester">DLTJ</acronym></i>.  I probably won't focus as much on the textbook ecosystem and accessibility services in higher education, but I'm sure these topics will be replaced by others.  If anything, hopefully the posting frequency will increase back to its previous roughly-10-posts-per-month level.</p>
<p>Please update your contact information for me.  My phone number is <a href="tel:+16782352955">+1-678-235-2955</a> and e-mail address is <a href="mailto:Peter.Murray@lyrasis.org">Peter.Murray@lyrasis.org</a>.</p>
