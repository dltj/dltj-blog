  content: "I can't see the Google Book link for <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> either!
    Is it just me? Or does somebody at Google hate you?\r\n\r\nI noticed that Google
    has an earlier (1923) edition of <i><a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=F49lAAAAMAAJ&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions_r&amp;cad=7\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">Life on the Mississippi</a></i> too, also apparently without
    full text; shouldn't that be out of copyright?"

  content: "Conal --  When I look at the catalog record as of 8:20am EDT this morning,
    the link to \"Read at Google Books\" is there.  We are inserting this into the
    page via HTML, so you might want to be sure that JavaScript is enabled.  The <a
    href=\"http://browserspy.dk/javascript.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">BrowserSpy JavaScript
    page</a> will help.  You should see at least \"Generic JavaScript support\" and
    JavaScript through version 1.3 support.  If not, please let me know the UserAgent
    result and the Operating System result from <a href=\"http://browserspy.dk/useragent.php\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">BrowserSpy's UserAgent Information</a> page.  We'll try to sort
    out why it isn't working for you based on that information.\r\n\r\nRegarding the
    1923 edition, the rule of thumb is that a work is in the public domain if published
    and copyrighted <em>before</em> 1923.  For 1923 and after, the question of in
    copyright or not gets considerably more interesting.  An overview of the complexity
    is at Cornell's <a href=\"http://www.copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">Copyright Term and the Public Domain in the United States</a>
    page."

  content: "I'm running Firefox 3.5 on Windows. My HTTP user agent string is:\r\n
    <blockquote>Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090729
    Firefox/3.5.2 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI definitely have Javascript
    enabled though. When I switched on FireBug (the JS debugger) and stepped through
    the code, I noticed that it was looking for div elements with class attributes
    of \"gbs\", but there were no such divs in the HTML, and that seems to be why
    it failed. \r\n\r\nI hope that helps."

  content: "Oh my lord. US Copyright law is even stupider than I thought. As if the
    \"author's life + 70 years\" rule wasn't restrictive enough.\r\n\r\nI bet Sam
    Clemens is enjoying those fat royalty checks OH WAIT, HE'S BEEN DEAD FOR ALMOST
    100 YEARS MY BAD. I know the US likes to pretend that corporations are people,
    but it's hard to argue that anyone, much less society as a whole, actually benefits
    from this foolishness."

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/OhioLINK/status/3543738573" title="http://twitter.com/OhioLINK/status/3543738573"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/The-OhioLINK-catalog-now-h-..._1251334585177.png" alt="OhioLINK Tweet for Adding Google Books links in the Central Catalog" title="OhioLINK Tweet for Adding Google Books links in the Central Catalog" width="257" height="108" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1222" /></a>An interesting thing happened at my place of work (OhioLINK) today.  We recently added links to our central catalog pointing to manifestations in Google Books.  The way it was decided to set it up, though, was to only point to Google Books if the full text was available.  We <a href="http://twitter.com/OhioLINK/status/3543738573" title="@OhioLINK tweet on our addition of Google Books links in the central catalog">tweeted</a> about it to let our community know that this option was now available.  The tweet included a link to a particular record that showed (at the time) an example of this change:  <a href="http://olc1.ohiolink.edu/record=b11085401~S0" title="OhioLINK Central catalog record for Mark Twain's Life on the Mississippi">Mark Twain's <i>Life on the Mississippi</i></a>.</p>
<p>Others <span class="removed_link" title="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=OhioLINK+Google+Books">picked up on the tweet</span> and word got around.  This morning I noticed a <a href="http://friendfeed.com/glenhorton/4cbd481f/rt-ohiolink-catalog-now-has-links-to-google" title="RT @OhioLINK: The OhioLINK catalog now has links... - Glen Horton - FriendFeed">comment on one of those tweets via FriendFeed</a> -- the link to the full text was no longer visible on our sample record.  Odd, I thought, and I started poking around.  Other items in our catalog still showed the link to full text in Google Books.  And the <a href="http://kentlink.kent.edu/record=b1991301~S1" title="KentLINK catalog link for Mark Twain's Life on the Mississippi">same record in Kent State University's catalog</a>, using the same linking mechanism, had <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=vDuwAAAAIAAJ&amp;source=gbs_ViewAPI" title="Life on the Mississippi - Google Books">a link to the item in Google Books</a>, but -- and this is the kicker -- now only in "<a href="http://books.google.com/googlebooks/screenshots.html#snippetview" title="Google Books documentation for snippet view">snippet</a>" view.  And that is probably the appropriate view given the copyright date of 1951.</p>
<p>What we're guessing is that the book was erroneously in full view mode in Google Books.  The large number of hits -- caused by it being the example record in OhioLINK's blog posts and tweets -- triggered some sort of usage alarm at Google Headquarters, where someone (or some algorithm) took a second look at the classification of the item and changed the view from full to snippet.</p>
<p>In any case, we <a href="http://twitter.com/OhioLINK/statuses/3556319026" title="@OhioLINK tweet for updated example link">tweeted</a> a <a href="http://olc1.ohiolink.edu/record=b10623621~S0" title="OhioLINK catalog link for Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice">second example</a> that, given its copyright year of 1918, will most likely remain in full view mode.
<p style="padding:0;margin:0;font-style:italic;" class="removed_link">The text was modified to remove a link to http://search.twitter.com/search?q=OhioLINK+Google+Books on September 26th, 2013.</p>
