<p>It was <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/12/encouraging-people-to-contribute.html" title="Official Google Blog: Encouraging people to contribute knowledge">announced on December 13th last year</a> with much discussion <a href="/article/google-knol/">here on <acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester"><i>DLTJ</i></acronym></a> and <span class="removed_link" title="http://technorati.com/search/knols?authority=a4&amp;language=en">elsewhere on the blogosphere</span>.  It would seem uncharacteristic of Google to announce something like that and keep the world waiting for months to see at least a beta of the concept.  Is there some sort of technical problem with the concept?  Legal or business model problem?  Or was it just a trial balloon for a service yet to be developed and Google wanted some free market research from the community?</p>
<p>Anybody know?</p>
