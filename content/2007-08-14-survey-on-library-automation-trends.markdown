<p>Marshall Breeding, editor of <a href="http://www.librarytechnology.org" title="http://www.librarytechnology.org">Library Technology Guides homepage</a>, is conducting a <a href="http://www.librarytechnology.org/blog.pl?ThreadID=6" title="Description of the library automation survey">survey on the trends in library automation</a>.  He describes the survey in a <a href="http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.education.web4lib/9683" title="Web4Lib posting announcing the library automation survey">web4lib mailing list posting</a>:<br />
<blockquote>I am conducting a survey on library automation trends. The survey aims to measure how well libraries are satisfied with their automation systems and the companies or other organizations that support them. It also attempts to get some indication of whether libraries are looking favorably on open source software for their automation system.</p></blockquote>
<p>The survey leverages the "Library Technology Guides" list and the <a href="http://www.librarytechnology.org/libwebcats" title="list of library catalogs">lib-web-cats</a> list of library catalogs.  You'll need to register for the Library Technology Guides website and then <a href="http://www.librarytechnology.org/lwc-survey-2007.pl" title="Library Technology Guides&#039; Survey of Library Automation Trends">read the survey instructions</a>.</p>
