  content: "Well said. (I could quibble about how good the current OCLC solution is,
    but it's certainly far better than it was and moving in the right direction. Hopefully
    not too late). \r\n\r\nInterestingly, the general issue applies to end-user consumers
    too, getting 'their own data' out of the facebooks and googles (and out of library
    apps?)\r\n\r\nBut I agree that libraries-as-customers need to start doing something
    to ensure they have access to their own data. There are scary stories of a certain
    vendor, when finding out a library customer is planning on switching to a different
    vendor, actually removing the customer's access to the product entirely to make
    getting data out entirely impossible. \r\n\r\nThis is definitely something that
    library customers absolutely require to be able to do business effectively, and
    be able to choose to switch vendors.  Some of the barriers (not an exclusive list),
    however, include:  \r\n\r\n1) It's not just a policy issue, the vendor also needs
    to provide technological capacity to export your data in usable formats. Leaving
    aside the fact that lack of standards (or workable standards) sometimes mean that
    it's unclear what a 'usable format' is for certain types of data, it also means
    the vendors will have to actually do some development to support this, and vendors
    are understandably not excited about spending development resources on a feature
    who's primary use case is letting current customers avoid vendor lock-in! Unless
    customers, esp potential customers, start demanding it, of course. \r\n\r\n2)
    With products like SerSol's e-resources knowledge base, there can be some legitimate
    disagremeent about what parts of the data 'belong to' the customer, and what parts
    are 'proprietary'.  Since there is no standard identification of vendors and product
    packages (there is standard identification for individual titles -- the ISSN,
    ISBN, LCCN, and OCLCnum!) -- customers have to record their data within an overall
    structure/taxonomy created by the vendor, which the vendor might reasonably consider
    proprietary.  Perhaps reasonably, but it still leads to a situation where one's
    'own data' (the info a customer spent it's own staff time to enter on what vendor
    product packages one subscribes to and what titles within those packages) is locked
    in and not 'owned' by the customer. Which is simply not tolerable."

  content: |-
    My first inclination is that it would be wise to remove the question mark from "and out of library apps", but -- like privacy -- I don't think data portability is something that is at the top of the minds of library patrons/customers.  A shame, to be true, but I suspect pretty close to fact.  That said, providing that kind of ability for patrons to get their information -- what little we traditionally keep -- out of our systems should be a priority as well.

    I agree that it is not just a policy issue.  There are technical needs and <i>ad hoc</i> standards that need to be addressed to actually implement the policy to get library data out of vendor systems.  The bibliographic data, and to some extend holdings data, is relatively easy: the MARC format handles that.  Patron transaction information, billing and payment data, and a whole host of other things are more up in the air.

    Because some of the data in the data structures might be considered proprietary is an important reason to have vendors at the table as well.  As customers, we can try to create model language that demands what we want, but if it isn't workable from the supplier side it will get ignored.

    Thanks for the comments, Jonathan.

  content: "Peter:\r\nGood post.  I was talking to a colleague about this and we agreed
    on a point I want to share.  Which is while it is a good idea to define a &lsquo;model
    language&rsquo; we should be careful not to let the aspiration for the *ideal*
    \ kill (or at least delay) the chance of a good enough solution. We felt, given
    our experiences, that it would be much more pragmatic to start with a list of
    very specific &ldquo;fundamental&rdquo; data rights, that are basic enough (but
    also: important enough), so that chances are high that they would be accepted
    without too many machinations on the part of those who need to agree in order
    for it to happen.  Certainly, the issue of holdings data, as I described in my
    original post, would be a good starting point and there are plenty of \"agreements\"
    needed just for that one to happen.  However, once it happened, a foundation will
    have been created upon which to base expansion."

  content: "Ah, a good point, Carl.  Since the contracts would be renewed periodically
    (perhaps even yearly), this is model language that is quite amenable to iteration.
    \ As you describe, it would also provide some good momentum for the process.  \n\nThat
    said, there isn't much momentum to try this now:  some retweets plus your comment
    and Jonathan's comment.  I think this would be a useful thing to do, but at the
    moment I don't have any extra time to devote to creating a draft.  Some day I
    might, and I'm willing to join a groundswell of effort, should one develop."

<p>In September, Carl Grant wrote a blog post on the ownership of library data ("<a href="http://thoughts.care-affiliates.com/2012/09/we-have-problem-another-vendor.html" title="We have a problem... another vendor appearing to need education about exactly WHO owns library data | Thoughts from Carl Grant">We have a problem... another vendor appearing to need education about exactly WHO owns library data</a>") that has been rolling around my own thoughts for, well, months.  The spark of Carl's post was a Twitter conversation where a major library system vendor appeared to be taking steps to limit what library/customers can do with their own data.</p>

<p><script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This harkens back to the <a href="http://wiki.code4lib.org/index.php/OCLC_Policy_Change" title="OCLC Policy Change | Code4Lib Wiki">OCLC records use policy furor of 2008-2010</a>. (In case you don't remember, the heart of the matter was a proposed transition to a policy that seemed to significantly limit the reusability of descriptive information in WorldCat, particularly in light of new desired use cases like <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/lld/" title="W3C Library Linked Data Incubator Group">library linked data</a>. <a href="/article/oclc-records-use-policy-1/#in-series">I</a> was one that was in favor of a more open policy.) There is a critical difference to note, though. In the OCLC records use policy case the feedback prompted the cooperative's board of trustees to <a href="http://www.oclc.org/worldcat/recorduse/policy/history.htm" title="History, WorldCat Rights and Responsibilities for the OCLC Cooperative | OCLC">create a public forum for debate and rough consensus building</a>. The result was a <a href="http://www.oclc.org/worldcat/recorduse/default.htm" title="WorldCat record use and data licensing | OCLC">revised policy</a> that was true to the needs of the cooperative while enabling new uses of data to be tried and implemented. In fact, we see tangible results of this effort in the <a href="http://www.oclc.org/news/releases/2012/201238.htm" title="OCLC adds linked data to WorldCat.org | OCLC Press Release">recent announcement of library linked data embedded into WorldCat.org pages</a>. ((As an aside, I was <a href="/article/oclc-review-board-blog/">critical about the lack of openness to the process</a>, but I'll readily acknowledge that the output of the process is a a great compromise. The clarification about linking with an <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20121004165832/http://www.oclc.org/us/en/data/attribution.html" title="Linked data attribution | OCLC">OCLC URL being sufficient to denote attribution in linked data contexts</a> is particularly helpful.  In retrospect, the process worked well.))</p>
<p>What we have here is something quite different. The case that Carl points out involves a private company making a decision about a library's data. And I don't think this is limited to the named vendor; there can easily be other cases where vendors want to treat library data as a competitive advantage and make getting it difficult to keep that advantage.  The channels to make the company's management respond are limited and narrow. In fact, a public calling out may not be sufficient to get action. Carl's post has suggestions on what libraries can do to protect themselves. I'd like to add one other possibility: the creation of model language that libraries can use at subscription or renewal time that spells out their expectations and desires for their data.</p>
<p>When I entered the library profession about 20 years ago, it was somewhat common for libraries to put software escrow clauses in their contracts; in the event the company no longer provided support for software the library purchased to run on its own systems (whether due to bankruptcy or other reasons), the library had the right to access the source code and internal system documentation stored with a third party. It was a form of protection for the library such that it could continue operations in the event of a failure of the software company. Such clauses fell out of fashion, coinciding somewhat to the move from purchase to subscription service models. This is one form of precedent for libraries managing technology risk.</p>
<p>A more recent example is the <a href="http://www.niso.org/workrooms/seru" title="Shared E-Resource Understanding (SERU) | National Information Standards Organization">NISO Shared Electronic Resource Understanding</a> (SERU) best practice. This is an agreement between content distributors and content licensors that covers the common cases of uses of digital information under copyright law without the overhead of getting lawyers involved in complex and detailed license negotiations. Representatives from distributors and licensors came together to forge this common understanding for the benefit of all.</p>
<p>Yet another contemporary example is the <a href="http://www.dataliberation.org/" title="the Data Liberation Front">data liberation portal</a> set up by Google staff. Through this portal you can see instructions on how to access data in various Google services in the event you want to transfer that data to another service.</p>
<p>What is called for in this case is some combination of these three exemplars. I think what we need is:</p>
<ol>
<li>clauses in legal agreements with providers that govern the ability for libraries to access their own data about their own operations;</li>
<li>combined with a process through which representatives in the profession come to agreement on the best model language for contract clauses;</li>
<li>plus the transparency of commitments an process exemplified by data liberation.</li>
</ol>
<p>This could be a project that goes through the formal process of best practices work in a forum like NISO. Or it could start as an <i>ad hoc</i> effort using the <a href="http://wiki.code4lib.org/" title="Code4Lib Wiki">Code4Lib wiki</a> plus a mailing list to manage discussion. Or some other mechanism the community creates.</p>
<p>I'm interested in this from two perspectives. First, as a library professional I think it is an important way for a library to mitigate risks to it operations. Second, as someone employed by a not-for-profit providing Software-as-a-Service options to libraries I want to ensure any model language is workable for the service provider.</p>
