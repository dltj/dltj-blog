<p><a href="http://quintessenceofham.org/2009/06/04/thomson-reuters-lawsuit-dismissed/" title="Thomson Reuters Lawsuit Dismissed  at  The Quintessence of Ham">Reported by Zotero co-director Sean Takats</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/dancohen/status/2031516508" title="Twitter / Dan Cohen: Thomson Reuters case again ...">tweeted by CHNM director Dan Cohen</a>, and <a href="/article/gmu-zotero-response/#comment-36332">noted on <acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester"><i>DLTJ</i></acronym> by Rick</a>, Thomson-Reuters' lawsuit against George Mason University has been dismissed.  The details are sparse at the moment, but it would appear that the creators of <a href="http://www.zotero.org/" title="Zotero | Home">Zotero</a> have prevailed over the creators of <a href="http://www.endnote.com/" title="EndNote - Bibliographies Made Easy">EndNote</a>.  <a href="http://quintessenceofham.org/2009/06/04/thomson-reuters-lawsuit-dismissed/" title="Thomson Reuters Lawsuit Dismissed  at  The Quintessence of Ham">Sean's post</a> has the most information.  (The Fairfax (VA) Circuit Court website really stinks in terms of disseminating information about the proceedings of the court. ((The <a href="http://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/courts/circuit/civil_records.htm" title="Civil Records - Fairfax County, Virginia - Circuit Court">procedures</a> bear a striking resemblance to Arthur Dent's comment in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy">Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a>: "It was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying 'Beware of the Leopard'."  That is neither here nor there, though.)) ) If the details are interesting, and I somehow expect they might be, I'll post them here.</p>
