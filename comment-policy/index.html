<p>Welcome to <i><acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester">DLTJ</acronym></i>.  I hope what you read here inspires you to add to the conversation.  Please consider these policies as you create your comment.</p>
<h2>Civility</h2>
<p>Be respectful of others, and call me out if you see me being disrespectful.  Personal attacks and hate speech will not be tolerated.  I will not delete comments that disagree with me as long as they are done in good taste.</p>
<h2>Identity</h2>
<p>Signed comments are preferred; pseudonymous comments are allowed, but a real e-mail address is required.  The e-mail address will not be publicly posted.  Impersonation is forbidden.</p>
<h2>Off-topic Comments and Spam</h2>
<p>Comments must be directed to the original topic or to comments made by others.  Off-topic comments will be gently redirected.  The comments feature on <i><acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester">DLTJ</acronym></i> does not exist for you to promote yourself, your employer, your workplace, or your goods/services.  Spam messages will be deleted on sight.  I will determine whether a comment is off-topic or spam.  Appeals may be made by e-mail.</p>
<h2>Links</h2>
<p>Appropriate links are allowed in comments.  All links in comments have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nofollow" title="nofollow | Wikipedia">rel="nofollow"</a> attribute added to them, so don't expect any "<a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?GoogleJuice" title="Google Juice">Google Juice</a>" from links in comments.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trackback" title="Trackback - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Trackback</a> links are encouraged as a way to continue a conversation, but the destination of links will be monitored and deleted if they fall into the "spam" category.</p>
<h2>Technology Aids</h2>
<p>This blog is using the <a href="http://akismet.com/" title="Akismet">Akismet Spam Filter</a> in an attempt to cut down on the amount of manual spam processing I need to do.  If these are causing problems for you (for instance, you don't see your comment immediately posted), please let me know so I can fish it out of the spam queue.</p>
<h2>Editor's Prerogative</h2>
<p>I reserve the right to edit comments to bring them in line with the policy or to correct links.  If a comment is edited, it will be noted at the end.  If you disagree with my edits, provide alternate text or let me know if you want the comment deleted.</p>
<h2>Assignment of Rights</h2>
<p>You, and only you, are responsible for your words. They are yours; however, by posting your comments to <i><acronym title="Disruptive Library Technology Jester">DLTJ</acronym></i> you are granting me a non-exclusive license, in perpetuity, to use, alter, and/or display them.</p>
<h2>In Summary...</h2>
<p><strong>This is not an open forum.</strong> Open conversations, even feisty ones, are welcomed and encouraged, but in the end this is my blog; you&rsquo;re a guest.</p>
