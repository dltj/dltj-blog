# Multiple Google Accounts? Use ‘authuser’ to Get to the One You Want

I have four Google accounts, and I often want to start a task in a particular one: open Google Drive in my work account, see the list of Google Slides presentations in my professional account, and read email in my personal account.  
For a while I would just go to `mail.google.com` and see which account comes up; if it isn’t the right one, I would switch using the drop-down menu in the upper right of the page.  
That is kind of a pain, though.

Enter the `authuser` URL parameter!  
With this parameter and your Google email address, you can jump right into the service that you want. 
For instance:

* Google Mail: https://mail.google.com?authuser=jester@dltj.org
* Google Calendar:
* Google Drive:
* Google Docs:
* Google Sheets:
* Google Slides:
* Google Voice:

I have folders of these in my Firefox Bookmark bar, so I am just two clicks away from getting into any one of these services.  
The `authuser` trick might work for other Google services, too.  
Did you find one that I didn’t mention?  Let me know @DataG on Twitter or @dltj@
